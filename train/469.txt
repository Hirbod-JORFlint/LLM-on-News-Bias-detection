“She talked about voting rights, she talked about climate change, and she talked about guns. You did not hear any of those subjects from the president of the United States,” King told the panel. “Democrats believe that animates their coalition, they believe it helps them, they believe, especially on the issue of climate change, especially on the issue of voting rights, it helps them to talk about things that the president won’t talk about.”
“Well, all Americans should want our President, whatever the disagreements are, just look at his own national security review. Every leader, whatever his party should be talking about climate change.

But that the President of the United States, at this moment in the world, did not mention climate change in even a sentence is, just frankly, a disgrace- any president, Democrat or Republican.”
Climate change has been a hot topic in the mainstream media. NBC News’ Chuck Todd recently dedicated a full one-hour special on climate change that banned any climate change skeptics.
