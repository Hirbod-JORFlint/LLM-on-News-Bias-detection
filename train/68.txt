The study notes that ice levels during the summer have been steadily shrinking over the past 30 years, due to climate change. The researchers ran a number of simulations, with most showing the "the Arctic Ocean becomes practically sea ice-free (sea‐ice area < 1 million km2) in September for the first time before the year 2050."

The researchers add that the sea-ice loss in the future is dependent on carbon emissions. "If emissions are reduced rapidly, ice-free years only occur occasionally," the statement added. "With higher emissions, the Arctic Ocean will become ice-free in most years."
More than 40 climate models from 21 research institutes around the world were used by the researchers to come up with their findings. The rapid decline in sea ice levels is believed to be linked to high carbon dioxide emissions and "little climate protection," according to the statement.

Skeptics have largely dismissed fears over man’s impact on global warming, saying climate change has been going on since the beginning of time. They also claim the dangers of a warming planet are being wildly exaggerated and question the impact that fossil fuels have had on climate change.
