Title: Stephen Colbert Compares ‘Nationalist’ Trump to the Ku Klux Klan

Spotlight: CBS Late Show host Stephen Colbert claimed on Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s describing himself as a “nationalist” serves as an indication of his hidden sympathy for white nationalist movements such as Ku Klux Klan.

“You know what I am? I’m a nationalist. Okay? A nationalist. Use that word,” Trump said during his rally in Texas on Monday evening. After showing the footage, Stephen Colbert contended that there is no difference between civic nationalism and white nationalism.
“You know why you’re not supposed to use that word? Because it’s the second half of ‘white nationalist,’” Colbert said. “Chopping off the first word doesn’t change what it means in our minds! Oh look, I’m a Klux Klan. I have no idea which one! Don’t judge me! There are all kinds of Klux Klans!”
Colbert went on to play a clip of Trump decrying globalism, an ideology he described as people who “want the globe to do well, but frankly not caring about our country so much.”
“He does realize that America is on the globe, right?” Colbert asked, before imitating Trump: “Look, I’m gonna shoot you straight: who cares about global warming? Wake me up when it’s America warming.”
During the segment, Colbert also bemoaned the fact that Barack Obama is no longer president.
“Yesterday the president had an important message,” he said, before showing a clip of Obama declaring the midterms an opportunity to “restore some sanity to our politics.”
“Come back, why did you leave, it’s our fault?” Colbert responded, before pretending to cry. “You said you were just going out for a pack of smokes.”
