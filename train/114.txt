Title: Media Reports Trump Comments Wildly Out Of Context, Claiming He Said George Floyd Is Happy About Jobs Report

Spotlight: A full video of the president’s speech makes it clear he was referring to equal treatment by law enforcement, but media claim he said George Floyd would be happy about the jobs report.

Content Text:
After President Donald Trump’s news conference on a positive jobs report Friday morning, the mainstream media contorted a quote from the president to falsely convey he thinks George Floyd is happy about the jobs numbers.
Newsweek issued the utterly false claim that “Donald Trump says economic growth is a solution to systemic racism.”

Full footage of Trump’s remarks makes it clear that he was actually referring to equal treatment by law enforcement, not the jobs report. But that hasn’t stopped the media from spreading the blatantly false story.
Erik Wasson, reporter for Bloomberg News, tweeted that “Trump says that he hopes George Floyd is looking down from heaven and happy about the strong jobs numbers.”
Wasson changed his story in his own replies to his tweet, which he has since deleted. After a Twitter user challenged his claim, Wasson doubled down, claiming Trump “absolutely did say it. Said today is a great day for equality.” The original tweet has since been deleted.

Peter Baker of the New York Times picked up the lie, tweeting that “Trump suggests that George Floyd would be happy about the jobs numbers.”
Baker has since deleted his tweet, explaining that “There’s some question about what Trump was referring to when he said George Floyd would think this is a ‘great day for him.’”

Bloomberg’s Jennifer Jacobs also ran with it, tweeting “George Floyd would be pleased with strong jobs data, Trump says.”

George Floyd would be pleased with strong jobs data, Trump says. "Hopefully, George is looking down right now and saying there’s a great thing happening for our country."

Politico’s Gabby Orr, in a tweet that has since been taken down, said “Wow. Trump suggests George Floyd is marveling at today’s jobs numbers from Heaven.”
Adam Cancryn, also of Politico, quoted Trump out of context with the false caption: “Trump imagining George Floyd’s reaction to the jobs numbers.”

Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, reacted: “This is vile. The President is co-opting the memory of George Floyd and exploiting the Black Lives Matter movement to praise the economy.” Her tweet appears to have been since deleted.
News outlets like Business Insider and the New York Daily News jumped on the false headline, proclaiming “Trump suggests George Floyd is ‘looking down’ from heaven and appreciating the US’ strong May jobs report” and “Trump says George Floyd is ‘looking down’ from heaven because of the marginal unemployment drop.”

Even the Associated Press jumped on the false narrative, with the misleading line that Trump mentioned Floyd “while touting the jobs report.”

Politico also ran the false headline, “President Trump touted the improved unemployment numbers in the Rose Garden this morning and said they marked a ‘great day’ for George Floyd.”

Other reporters simply clipped the quote where Trump referenced George Floyd, presenting it as if in reference to the jobs report and failing to include the context in which the president made it clear he was talking about justice and equal treatment by law enforcement. A longer clip reveals Trump’s actual meaning:
Equal justice under the law must mean that every American receives equal treatment in every encounter with law enforcement, regardless of race color gender or creed. They have to receive fair treatment from law enforcement. They have to receive it. We all saw what happened last week; we can’t let that happen. Hopefully George is looking down right now and saying, ‘this is a great thing that’s happening for our country.’ It’s a great day for him, it’s a great day for everybody.

Still, that didn’t stop reporters including the Associated Press’ Jill Colvin, CNN’s Manu Raju and Jake Tapper, and CNN’s Kaitlan Collins from falsely presenting the quote out of context.

CBS News’ Vladimir Duthiers clipped the quote from Trump, claiming that “I had to clip this because it is unbelievable.” In reality, his edit job excluded further statements from the president making it clear the statements were about racial justice, not about the jobs report.

I had to clip this because it is unbelievable. President @realDonaldTrump just said this: “Hopefully, George is looking down right and saying this is a great thing that’s happening for our country. It’s a great day for him, it’s a great day for everybody.” #GeorgeFloyd pic.twitter.com/6CbGoLJrRg
