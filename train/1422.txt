Protesters in England cheer as a statue of Edward Colton, a 17th century slave-trader, is torn down.
However, the Bristol protest took things a step further with the dismantling of the Edward Colston statue.

Using ropes, the protesters were able to pull the bronze statue from its foundations. At least one protester posed for photos while kneeling on the statue’s neck, a reference to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, which helped spark global protests against police brutality.

Protesters then dragged the statue through the city streets to the harbor, where they threw the statue into the water. The empty space the statue had previously occupied became a platform for protesters to make speeches. 
While Colston used some of his considerable wealth for philanthropic improvements to Bristol, London and elsewhere, many activists could not overlook the source of his income. 
Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees made a statement of support for the protests. 
“I know the removal of the Colston Statue will divide opinion, as the statue itself has done for many years,” Rees said. “However, it’s important to listen to those who found the statue to represent an affront to humanity.”
He added, “Let’s make the legacy of today about the future of our city, tackling racism and inequality.”
