Title: What we know: 2,411 fetal remains found in possession of ex-Indiana abortion doctor

Content Text:
After Dr. Ulrich Klopfer died in rural Crete, Illinois, on Sept. 3, authorities found "2,246 medically preserved fetal remains" in his home. Weeks later, authorities found more in his Mercedes-Benz, bringing the total to 2,411.
Klopfer performed thousands of abortions in northern Indiana clinics before his medical license was revoked in 2016. It's unclear where the fetal remains came from, though the Will County, Illinois, Sheriff's office said in a news release there is no evidence that Klopfer performed abortions on his Illinois property.
Public records show that Klopfer had not been licensed to practice medicine in Illinois since 1990, when he failed to renew his license. Records do not show Klopfer holding any other state's medical license after the Indiana suspension.
Authorities have not said if they think Klopfer, 79, transported the remains from Indiana or why the remains were in his possession in the first place. Will County Sheriff Mike Kelley said at a news conference Thursday that the remains were found in sealed plastic bags with formalin, a chemical used to preserve biological material. 
"I've never seen anything like this ever," said Kelley, a 31-year veteran of the Will County Sheriff's Office. "It's one of those once-in-a-lifetime things." 
James Glasgow, Will County state's attorney, said the remains were from the years 2000 to 2002.

The finding of the remains should "shock the conscience of every American," Vice President and former Indiana Gov. Mike Pence said on Twitter. He called for a thorough investigation of the findings, as did South Bend mayor and 2020 presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg. 
Buttigieg said the finding is "extremely disturbing" and "unacceptable." 
"I also hope it doesn’t get caught up in politics at a time when women need access to health care," Buttigieg said.
According to a complaint filed by the Indiana Medical Licensing Board, Klopfer worked in clinics in South Bend, Gary and Fort Wayne from 2012 to 2015. 
Indiana records allege the doctor, first licensed in 1979, had a history of bad record-keeping in his clinics.

The board in 2016 found that Klopfer failed to properly file paperwork regarding abortions performed at the clinics, including some that were dated the same day as the procedure, a violation of Indiana's 18-hour waiting period.
The licensing board found he performed abortions on two 13-year-olds without filing paperwork within three days as required by law.
The board indefinitely suspended Klopfer's medical license on Nov. 22, 2016.
The allegations regarding the 13-year-olds led to misdemeanor criminal charges in two counties, which Klopfer was facing at the same time he fought to keep his medical license, records show.
He was charged with failing to timely file a public report and admitted wrongdoing in St. Joseph County in 2014 and Lake County in 2015, according to the licensing board's complaint. Under terms of the pretrial diversion agreements, the misdemeanor charges were later dismissed.
None of the Indiana allegations against Klopfer were related to fetal remains. How such remains ended up on Klopfer's property are a mystery.
In the news release, the Will County Sheriff's office said a lawyer for the Klopfer family first told officials about the discovery of the fetal remains. IndyStar left a message on Monday for the attorney, identified by WMAQ-TV (Channel 5) Chicago as Kevin P. Bolger.
Klopfer's family had no idea the fetal remains were inside the doctor's rural home, Bolger told WMAQ on Saturday.
"No one has any answers," Bolger told the station. "The family is cooperating 100%."
Hill told IndyStar on Monday that the discovery of the fetal remains "shocks the conscience." Hill said his office will work with the office of Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul on an investigation into the "grisly" findings.
