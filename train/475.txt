Instead, Ballard offered a passionate speech about racial equality and social injustice in the wake of the protests sparked across the nation against police brutality.
“Black lives matters," he said. "I don’t understand why that’s so freaking hard for the white community to say. Black lives matter. I’ve been ignorant. I’ve been ignorant to the real problem and I’m ashamed of that. I just came to the realization to that over the last 10 days with some really hard, difficult conversations that we’ve had as an organization, as a team, with my family, with my sons and I’ve been ignorant to the real problem.
“This is not a black problem. This is a white problem. This is an issue that we have to talk about and we can’t sugarcoat it. We can’t sugarcoat our way out of this. We can’t go back into our bubble because that’s what we’ve always done. We’ve always gone right back into our bubble and we’ve never really listened. We haven’t listened. I haven’t listened. We haven’t listened as a country. White America refuses to listen. We want to keep things the same and it can’t or we’ll continue down the same paths we’re continuing down. That has to change and nothing will change until we do that.”
Ballard added that he thinks he was doing things that hurt people in the past.
The general manager’s speech comes as NFL organizations are trying to address racial injustices in the U.S. and find ways to make changes.
