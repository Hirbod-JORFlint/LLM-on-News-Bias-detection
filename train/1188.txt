Her “MSNBC Live” panel was discussing the proposal from Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., against what they described as the “ultra-rich.”
Warren's campaign described her plan last week as “a bold proposal to tax the wealth of the richest 0.1% of Americans.  The legislation, which applies only to households with a net worth of $50 million or more, is estimated by leading economists to raise $2.75 trillion in tax revenue over a 10-year period.”
With the possibility of the billionaire Howard Schultz, onetime Starbucks CEO, entering the 2020 race as a third-party presidential candidate -- and taking away votes from possible Democratic nominees -- the topic of wealth and taxation has become a primary political topic.
Conservative commentator John Podhoretz countered Tur on her assertion.
“Middle class is an income level,” Podhoretz said.
He added, “The median income in this country has gone up $6,000 in the last two years from $47-53,000 a year.”
Tur countered with, “So everyone’s doing fine?”
“I’m not saying everyone’s doing fine, but you just said that there’s no middle class anymore. That’s a crazy thing to say, Katy,” Podhoretz said.
