Title: Trump’s base a blessing and a curse in shutdown

Content Text:
Senior FBI leadership was disturbed by President Trump's comments on Comey's termination, including an Oval Office meeting where he told the Russian foreign minister the firing eased pressure.
In short, Trump has succeeded too well in convincing Republicans of the rightness of his position. Nearly 90 percent of self-identified Republicans say there is a crisis at the border. Taken in those stark terms, it becomes increasingly hard for Trump to negotiate without appearing to betray his loyalists and, by their reckoning, national security.
Trump said it’s the wall or nothing and Republicans rallied to his side. Unfortunately, that leaves him at odds with the 63 percent of the electorate that disagrees.
These numbers also help illuminate Democrats’ thinking: Since Trump has no wiggle room with his base, they are content to watch consequences pile up, driving Trump’s overall numbers further into the ditch.
