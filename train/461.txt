Kyomuhendo was at her aunt's house in Nawuyo village, Mbale District, with her father, Sheikh Hussein Byaruhanga Husain of Mbarara District, on May 4 when she called a friend of his whom she knew to be a Roman Catholic.
Husain reportedly told his sister that he was going to kill his daughter for converting to Christianity before he poured burning fuel on her that night, the eleventh day of the Islamic holiday Ramadan.
According to an observer, Kyomuhendo screamed for help before her aunt and a neighbor arrived.
“The neighbor arranged for a taxi-van that took her to a hospital, and she got immediate treatment," a source told the Christian news site.
The 24-year-old girl is expected to remain at Mbale Regional Referral Hospital for more than a month with serious burns on her leg, stomach, ribs, neck and portion of her back, according to the observer.
“Please pray for Kyomuhendo for a quick recovery on her hospital bed,” the source said.
Neither Kyomuhendo nor the neighbor reported the assault to the police for fear that her father might try to kill her, the source added.
Christians in eastern Uganda are among those in their faith who face the most serious dangers in the world, according to World Watch Monitor, a group that tracks persecutions of Christians.
