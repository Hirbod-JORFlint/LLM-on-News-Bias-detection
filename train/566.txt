Donald Trump is calling on lawmakers to completely ban any and all Muslims from entering the U.S. in order to protect the homeland amid heightened national security concerns.
"Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on," the Republican presidential hopeful's campaign wrote in a statement released Monday afternoon.
"Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension," Trump himself said in the statement.
