Officials from U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News. The Reuters report said it was unclear why the man killed himself. 
The U.S. moved aggressively over the past year to reduce the number of asylum seekers arriving at its southwest border through a series of measures aimed at making it a less attractive option.
In recent days, guidance was reportedly sent to U.S. asylum officials that said Mexicans would now be included in the so-called “Remain in Mexico” program that sent non-Mexican asylum seekers back to Mexico to await their asylum cases.
The Tamaulipas attorney general’s office said it was investigating the man’s death, Reuters reported.
