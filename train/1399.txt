D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham opens up about how his officers are working to control protests.
“It is ashame (sic) that Congress doesn’t do something about the lowlifes that burn the American Flag,” the president tweeted. “It should be stopped, and now!”
Police held a line in front of historic St. John’s Episcopal Church after it was vandalized again Monday with graffiti.
The National Park Service announced the park  would be closed Tuesday as it assesses the damage and begins to make repairs.
City officials and police also removed tents and canopies left by protesters attempting to set up an autonomous zone near the White House similar to one that recently turned violent in Seattle.
The Supreme Court has ruled flag burning is protected free speech.
