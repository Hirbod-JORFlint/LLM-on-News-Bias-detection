The Internet lashed out at Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) on Sunday after he told Americans to go to restaurants during the novel coronavirus pandemic.
“There’s a lot of concerns with the economy here because people are scared to go out,” Nunes told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo. “But I will just say, one of the things you can do if you’re healthy, you and your family, it’s a great time to just go out, go to a local restaurant.”
The advice did not go over well on Twitter, where people repeatedly referred to Nunes as an “idiot.”
