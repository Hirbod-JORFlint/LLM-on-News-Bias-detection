DiCaprio, himself a prominent environmental campaigner, met the 16-year-old Thunberg and shared photos of their meeting. In the post, he called her a “leader of our time.”
“History will judge us for what we do today to help guarantee that future generations can enjoy the same livable planet that we have so clearly taken for granted,” he wrote, adding: “I hope that Greta’s message is a wake-up call to world leaders everywhere that the time for inaction is over.”
DiCaprio said it was an “honor” to meet with Thunberg and that he is “optimistic about what the future holds” thanks to young activists like her.
“She and I have made a commitment to support one another, in hopes of securing a brighter future for our planet,” he added.
Meanwhile, Thunberg first made headlines when her Fridays for Future campaign went global in the last few months. At a U.N. climate conference in September, she repeatedly scolded world leaders, asking, “How dare you?”
