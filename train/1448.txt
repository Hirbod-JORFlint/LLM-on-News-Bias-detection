Ocasio-Cortez has previously ripped Trump’s “racist border wall” and said she would support exactly “$0” for it.
On Sunday’s 60 Minutes, Ocasio-Cortez also said there is “no question” that Trump is a “racist.”
“The president certainly didn’t invent racism. But he’s certainly given a voice to it and expanded it and created a platform for those things,” Ocasio-Cortez told 60 Minutes. “When you look at the words that he uses, which are historic dog whistles of white supremacy. When you look at how he reacted to the Charlottesville incident, where neo-Nazis murdered a woman, versus how he manufactures crises like immigrants seeking legal refuge on our borders, it’s— it’s night and day.”
