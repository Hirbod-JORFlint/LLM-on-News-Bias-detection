Climate activist celebrities and business leaders are facing backlash after arriving at Google Camp in Italy in private jets and yachts.
“It’s really nice that so many people have come up and sent their well wishes to Australia, but we have to do more than that,” the actor began. “It’s such a beautiful gesture... I’ve not always been a virtuous man. I’m learning so much and so many of you in this room have given me multiple opportunities to get it right, and I am grateful. But I think together, hopefully, we can be unified and actually make some changes.”

The star’s tone then shifted as he took a direct shot at climate activists in Hollywood that don’t walk-the-walk.
“It’s great to vote but sometimes we have to take that responsibility on ourselves and make changes and sacrifices in our own lives and hope that we can do that,” he concluded. “We don’t have to take private jets to Palm Springs for the award sometimes, or back. Please. And I’ll try to do better and I hope you will, too.”
