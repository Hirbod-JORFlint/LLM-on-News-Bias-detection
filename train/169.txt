Title: Wildlife in streets, less pollution in big cities: Earth looks different on Earth Day 2020

As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, this year's event is unlike any other we've experienced. 
While much of the globe hunkers down at home or in quarantine during the coronavirus pandemic, society looks quite different than it did on April 22, 1970 – or even April 22 of last year, for that matter. 
Amid closed restaurants, quiet office buildings and canceled sporting events, the new normal has had its fair share of environmental effects, with some areas in the U.S. reporting significant improvements in air quality. 
Animals have taken advantage of the absence of humans in some areas, too. Several lions were caught sunbathing on the road of a closed national park in South Africa. Meanwhile, penguins and dogs roamed through a nearly empty aquarium, leading to some incredible cross-animal interactions. 
Here's a look at some of the unique effects that coronavirus has had on our environment.
