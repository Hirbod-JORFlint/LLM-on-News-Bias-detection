Title: President Trump's Oval Office address: Democrats ask networks for equal airtime

Content Text:
WASHINGTON – As the partial government shutdown approaches a record length, President Donald Trump said Monday he will address the nation at 9 p.m. EST Tuesday on what he called the crisis at the nation's border.
The Democrats, citing their attempts to end the shutdown, issued a statement late Monday demanding equal TV time to respond Trump's speech. 
Trump said he will visit the U.S.-Mexican border Thursday to promote his plan for a wall to keep out undocumented immigrants, the sticking point in negotiations with Democrats to reopen the government.
Trump will "meet with those on the front lines of the national security and humanitarian crisis" at the border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders posted on Twitter. "More details will be announced soon."
Trump tweeted the announcement of his prime-time speech: "I am pleased to inform you that I will Address the Nation on the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border. Tuesday night at 9:00 P.M. Eastern."
Democrats said Trump and aides exaggerate the numbers of immigrants entering the country illegally to justify his stance on the wall.
"Trump shut down the government over a manufactured crisis at the border," the Democratic National Committee said in a statement.
Tuesday's speech, Trump's first from the Oval Office, will give him a chance to lay out his case on an issue that led to the shutdown. CBS, NBC, and ABC all said they intend to carry the address, which is expected to run no longer than eight minutes. 
Democratic congressional leaders - House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. - demanded the networks give them equal time to counter Trump.
“If past statements are any indication,” they said in a joint statement, Trump’s speech “will be full of malice and misinformation.”
Pelosi and Schumer said Trump should agree to a plan to re-open the government now while they continue to negotiate a border security plan. The House, now controlled by the Democrats, passed legislation last week to reopen the government. 
A CNN reporter tweeted late Monday that the network is planning to broadcast the Democrat response to Trump's speech. 
Trump, who first floated the idea of traveling to the border during a surprise visit to Iraq the day after Christmas, pressed lawmakers for $5.6 billion for the border wall. The shutdown entered its 17th day Monday.
The shutdown record is 21 days, set in 1995 and 1996. The current partial shutdown would hit its 22nd day at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
One possible site for Trump's border visit on Thursday: McAllen, Texas. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a notice to "expect VIP movement" in the McAllen area on Thursday.
As the White House announced Trump's visit, no resolution to the shutdown seemed in sight.
The weekend featured negotiations involving Vice President Mike Pence and congressional staff members, but officials reported no real progress toward a deal.
Monday, Pence described the weekend sessions as “productive” because they gave each side a “better understanding” of their top priorities.
The vice president said Trump plans to invite congressional leaders to the White House this week for more negotiations.
Pence said Trump has not decided whether to declare some kind of national emergency on the nation’s southern border, a move that would be designed to allow him to use defense funds for wall construction.
“It is something he is considering, looking into,” Pence said.
Democrats said that Trump lacks the legal authority to declare such an emergency and that he is using the wall as a political excuse to shut down the government.
The administration unveiled a border security plan it presented to congressional Democratic negotiators.
The proposal begins with $5.7 billion “for construction of a steel barrier for the Southwest border,” the very idea the Democrats object to.
Trump and aides cast the request for a steel barrier as a concession from the concrete structure they advocated; Democrats said there was no real difference between the two types of walls.
Other administration requests: $563 million for 75 additional immigration judges and support staff; $211 million for 750 additional Border Patrol agents; $571 million for 2,000 additional law enforcement personnel and staff; $4.2 billion for 52,000 additional detention beds; and $800 million to address “urgent humanitarian needs.”
In a letter to Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the administration requested $631 million for “counter-narcotics/weapons technology.”
“It’s more than a wall,” Pence said. “A lot more.”
Pence said he and his team will brief lawmakers throughout the week.
The White House has not said which state Trump plans to visit on his border excursion this week.
Trump traveled to San Diego in May to view prototypes of his proposed wall. Congress has approved additional money for border security in the past but specifically prohibited any of it from being spent on new wall designs. 
Congress responds: 'The goal is not to open up the government': Sen. Graham says no shutdown end without wall
Presidential powers: President Trump could declare a national emergency. But would that get him funds for a wall?
One Republican offered Trump advice about his speech.
"@realDonaldTrump when u give ur tv speech Tuesday night deliver it as if u were conversing with Iowans not New Yorkers," Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, posted on Twitter.
