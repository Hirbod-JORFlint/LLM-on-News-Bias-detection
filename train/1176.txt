Acting Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan has an update on the Trump administration's efforts to reduce border apprehensions.
Tear gas was fired on the migrants, some of whom threw rocks at Mexico's national guard militarized police, Reuters reported. The scramble of the mostly Honduran caravan led to some parents being separated from their children as they tried to avoid Mexican immigration agents.

“You have two options: You go back to Guatemalan territory or you come with us,” Mexican immigration agents said to migrants who had crossed the river.
“We didn’t come to stay here. We just want to cross to the other side,” said Ingrid, 18, a Honduran migrant. “I don’t want to go back to my country because there is nothing there, just hunger.”
Those caught will be taken to immigration stations and be returned to their home countries if their legal status cannot be resolved. Over the weekend, 2,000 migrants camped out in Guatemala in the town of Tecun Uman, opposite Ciudad Hidalgo on the Mexican side of the border.

At least 4,000 people entered Guatemala from Honduras since Wednesday, according to Guatemalan authorities. The latest caravan comes as the Trump administration has enlisted Central American leaders in taking a more active role in stemming the flow of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Most are fleeing endemic poverty and increasing rates of gang violence.
Denis Contreras, a Honduran who was denied asylum and deported from San Diego, vowed not to give up.
“Here we are, and we're not going anywhere, and if you throw us out, we'll return!” he said.

“We’re in Mexico, send us money," she said.
