Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has been an avid supporter of the "Green New Deal," a plan that would take dramatic steps to curb the United States' contribution to global climate change. But in a Fox News interview with Sean Hannity, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders turned to condescension.
Hannity and Sanders both yucked it up about members of the Millennial Generation, who Hannity said are worried the world is going to end in 12 years if something isn't done about climate change.
"I donâ€™t think that we are going to listen to her on much of anything, particularly anything that we will leave into the hands of a much, much higher authority," Sanders said, presumably referring to God. "And certainly not listen to the freshman congresswoman on when the world may end."
Sanders said the president is more focused on what is happening "in the world right now" instead of securing the United States for the future.
"We wish that Democrats would engage in that conversation and fixed some of the current problems that we know exist and work with us to get some things done," Sanders continued. "Particularly on the border and fixing the national and humanitarian crisis. That is what we are focused on. Not things we will leave up into the hands of something and someone much more powerful than any of us."
