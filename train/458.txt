CDC expands passenger screening to 20 airports in the U.S. in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
China’s embassy in Denmark said the “satirical drawing” by the Danish artist Niels Bo Bojesen was “lacking any form of sympathy or empathy,” and “transcended the lower boundaries of civilized society and the ethical boundary of freedom of expression, and insults human conscience.”
“The current outbreak of a new coronavirus has cost 81 precious lives in China,” the embassy said in a statement Tuesday, including a lower count of the virus’ death toll. 
“At the same time as the Chinese government and the Chinese people are making every effort to combat this unusual and urgent health threat, Jyllands-Posten has published a ‘satirical drawing’ by Niels Bo Bojesen which is an insult to China and hurts the feelings of the Chinese people.”
“We express our strong indignation and demand that Jyllands-Posten and Niels Bo Bojesen repent their mistake and publicly apologize to the Chinese people,” the Chinese embassy said in a statement. 
U.S. officials ordered workers at the U.S. consulate in Wuhan to return to the United States; Rich Edson reports from the State Department.
The Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Denmark (CCCD) echoed the embassy’s criticism of the cartoon. 
The same newspaper in 2005 sparked outrage across the Muslim world for its satirical drawings of the Prophet Muhammad. Five years after the cartoon’s publication, Danish police arrested three men for plotting a terrorist attack at the Jyllands-Posten building in Copenhagen.
