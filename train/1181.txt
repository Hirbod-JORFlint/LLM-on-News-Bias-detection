Border Patrol agents in Yuma, Arizona apprehend a group of over 100 Central Americans who illegally scaled the border wall.
In the video, which is 55-seconds long, a group of illegal immigrants can be seen scaling the wall with the help of a smuggler, who used a ladder.
The smuggler then runs away from the border wall, hauling the ladder.
The video was released a week after a group of 376 Central American migrants were apprehended after they also illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border near Yuma.
In that incident, authorities said the group -- which included 179 children -- dug under a steel barrier in seven spots about 10 miles east of a border crossing in San Luis and made no effort to elude immigration agents. The unusually large group was almost entirely from Guatemala and were taken to Yuma after entering the country.

Since the shutdown began, border officials in the Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol Sector in Texas have arrested over 14,000 illegal immigrants and confiscated over 14,000 pounds of marijuana and 800 pounds of cocaine, border patrol sources told Fox News.
Since October, authorities have also arrested more than 100 people believed to be El Salvadorian gang members in the same sector, the same sources added. The notorious MS-13 gang that originated in Los Angeles prisons before infiltrating the rest of the U.S. is mainly comprised of El Salvadorans.

The Rio Grande Valley Sector is where President Trump visited earlier this month to highlight what he called a crisis of crime and drugs along the southern border. Agents in the sector patrol an area of over 17,000 square miles in 19 counties, which includes 320 river miles and 250 coastal miles, according to CBP.
Rio Grande Sector Border Patrol Agent Chris Cabrera says more barriers are needed or agents are going to be in 'serious trouble.'
The men, who are ages 19 and 37, were then taken to a patrol station for processing. Agents determined they were from Honduras and illegally crossed the border into the U.S.
Authorities also found they were flagged as MS-13 members after the older suspect, who had previously illegally crossed into the U.S.,Â had been convicted of shoplifting and providing false information in Georgia.
The younger suspect had no prior criminal or immigration history in the U.S.
The southwest Arizona desert is less remote but arrests have also sharply increased after years of relative quiet. The Border Patrol's Yuma sector made 7,857 arrests in October and November, more than double the same period a year earlier.
