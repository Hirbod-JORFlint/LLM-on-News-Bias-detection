Former Vice President Joe Biden lied on Monday about his past position on the best way to deal with the novel Wuhan coronavirus rapidly spreading worldwide that would eventually bloom into a global pandemic.
“Whether we like it or not, this COVID pandemic has basically shut down the country the last three months and by the way, if we shut it down a month earlier, we’d have probably another forty-five to sixty-thousand people who’d be alive,” said the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, going on to pin the deaths on President Donald Trump. “I’m going to say something outrageous: he didn’t listen to guys like me back in January saying ‘we have a problem.'”

This is a gigantic lie told by Joe Biden.
He DID NOT call for a nationwide lockdown in January in response to the coronavirus.
If that were true, why did he keep holding campaign rallies into the 2nd week of March?

Biden however, said no such thing in January. To the contrary, Biden actually criticized the travel ban implemented against China early on to slow the virus arrival to U.S. shores as “xenophobic.”
“This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia,” Biden said at an Iowa campaign stop leading up to the first-in-the-nation contest.

Joe Biden opposed the China travel restrictions wisely put in place by President Trump in January – restrictions that health experts credit with slowing the spread of coronavirus & saving lives.

Biden’s latest slip-up comes days after the campaign took a hit last month telling Charlamagne tha God on the Breakfast Club podcast that “if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re voting for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.”
For the most part however, Biden’s campaign has faded into the background of American politics as the nation struggles to combat the coronavirus pandemic and a new surge in violent demonstrations engulfing the country in a storm of anarchy. Still, new a new ABC News/Washigton Post poll out this week shows Biden ahead in the polls by ten points while Trump leads a nation in peril.
