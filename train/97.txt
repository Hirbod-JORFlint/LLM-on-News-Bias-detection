Feb. 22 (UPI) — A sign reading “Refugees Welcome,” placed on the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty by an activist group, was quickly removed by National Park Service employees.
The sign, red with white lettering and approximately 20 feet by three feet in size, was seen attached to the statue in New York City at about 1 p.m. Tuesday. A group called Alt Lady Liberty took responsibility for the sign, later sending an email supportive of refugees, CNN reported.
“Almost all Americans have descendants from somewhere else. Immigrants and refugees make this country great. And turning away refugees, like we did to Anne Frank, does not make us great. Refugees are welcome here, Muslims are welcome here and immigrants are welcome here. And it’s not just our ancestors. Every American knows an immigrant or a refugee. We wanted to send a reminder about America when we’re at our best — the country that’s a beacon of freedom to the world, built by immigrants. Walling off countries or entire religions is against our values. That’s what the Statue of Liberty stands for.”
Posting of banners on national monuments violates the law. The sign was quickly taken down after it was determined it could be removed without damaging the statue, but not before photographs of it spread through social media.
The action came as President Donald Trump prepares to unveil a new travel ban to prevent terrorism, after a Jan. 27 executive order was blocked by a federal judge.
