Title: Conn. high school girls file lawsuit arguing that allowing transgender athletes to compete is sex discrimination

James Younger, the Texas child at the center of a transgender custody battle, reportedly went to school and church dressed as boy.
“Our dream is not to come in second or third place, but to win, fair and square,” Mitchell said. “All we’re asking for is a fair chance.”
The three are arguing that competing against biologically male athletes has denied them the chance to win medals and achieve scholarship opportunities.

“Inescapable biological facts of the human species [are] not stereotypes, ‘social constructs,’ or relics of past discrimination,” it says.
“In track-and-field events that do not use equipment, the physiological differences between males and females after puberty are stark in the record books,” the complaint adds. “No one doubts that top male and female high school athletes are equally committed to excelling in their sport, and train equally hard. Yet boys and men consistently run faster and jump higher and farther than girls and women.”
“I have faced discrimination in every aspect of my life and I no longer want to remain silent,” Miller said. “I am a girl and I am a runner. I participate in athletics just like my peers to excel, find community, and meaning in my life. It is both unfair and painful that my victories have to be attacked and my hard work ignored.”
Yearwood said she also has been hurt by the efforts to “tear down my successes.”
“I will never stop being me!” she said in her statement. “I will never stop running! I hope that the next generation of trans youth doesn’t have to fight the fights that I have. I hope they can be celebrated when they succeed not demonized. For the next generation, I run for you!”
The American Civil Liberties Union sought to intervene on Miller and Yearwood’s behalf, writing on Twitter that “this lawsuit is clearly about trans students, yet those students have no voice in the lawsuit. This is wrong. We at the ACLU will be seeking to intervene in this lawsuit as a new party, to give trans students a voice.”
The Connecticut Association of Schools and Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference, as well as the boards of education in Bloomfield, Cromwell, Glastonbury, Canton and Danbury are named as defendants in the case.
