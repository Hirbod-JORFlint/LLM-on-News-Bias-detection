Title: How Missouri abortion law compares to Illinois and 7 of its neighbors

Content Text:
Just days after Missouri Gov. Mike Parson signed a bill that bans abortions at or beyond the eighth week of pregnancy, Planned Parenthood said the state threatened to not renew its license for the state's lone abortion clinic. A judge granted a stay in the case Friday.
Missouri's new law goes into effect Aug. 28, barring any legal challenge. Doctors who violate the eight-week cutoff could face up to 15 years in prison.
Several clinics that provide abortions also provide other health care services like cancer screenings and prenatal care. Should the Planned Parenthood clinic, which is located in St. Louis, close, the nearest clinics that perform abortions to Missourians are in a suburb of Kansas City and in Granite City, Illinois, according to the Associated Press.
Here's what current laws are regarding abortion in each of Missouri's neighboring states:
The Illinois State House passed a bill Tuesday that would repeal state abortion laws that limited when abortions could be done and penalties for doctors who performed them. The "Reproductive Health Act" would also require insurance to cover the cost of such procedures.
“Lawmakers are not doctors. Doctors need to use the accepted standard of clinical care and to make their decision to the best of their knowledge,” bill sponsor Kelly Cassidy said.
When are abortions banned?
Current Illinois law bans abortion after a fetus is considered viable, usually around 24 weeks of pregnancy. Missouri's new law bans abortion after 8 weeks.
Missouri mandates a 72-hour waiting period after scheduling an abortion and requires minors to have the consent of a parent or guardian. Illinois carries none of those regulations.
Are there any exceptions?
In cases of medical emergencies, abortions are legal in both states. Illinois's current law defines this as in the case when a physicians' medical judgment determines that an abortion "is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother."
Illinois also covers the cost of abortion for Medicaid enrollees and state employees in cases of rape and incest. Missouri's new law doesn't provide funding or allow for abortions past the allotted eight weeks of pregnancy in cases of rape or incest.
What are the penalties?
Neither state has a penalty for pregnant woman, but rather for professionals involved in the abortion procedure.
In Missouri, doctors could face five to 15 years in prison if they perform an abortion past the allotted pregnancy time frame.
Illinois doctors who violate the law currently could be subject to criminal penalties, but the current proposed legislation would largely remove that threat for doctors who perform abortions at the consent of those who are pregnant. 
After Kentucky lawmakers passed their version of a "heartbeat" bill this March, the bill was immediately halted. U.S. District Judge David Hale issued the temporary restraining order barring the state from enforcing the law, which would have banned abortions once a heartbeat is detected, after about six weeks of pregnancy.
"I'm not operating on fear of the Supreme Court," said bill sponsor Rep. Chris Fugate. "This bill is to save the life of the unborn who are crying out and saying, 'I want to live,' every time their heart pumps blood."
When are abortions banned?
Current Kentucky law bans abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy. Missouri's new law bans abortion after 8 weeks.
Missouri mandates a 72-hour waiting period after scheduling an abortion and requires minors to have the consent of a parent or guardian. Kentucky requires a 24-hour waiting period after a medical professional tells the pregnant individual the age of the fetus, the nature, risks and alternatives to an abortion and the medical risks associated with pregnancy. 
Are there any exceptions?
In cases of medical emergencies, abortions are legal in both states. Neither state's newest laws make an exception for cases of rape or incest. Both states require the written consent of a parent or guardian in cases involving a minor unless the minor is married.
What are the penalties?
Neither state has a penalty for pregnant woman, but rather for professionals involved in the abortion procedure.
In Missouri, doctors could face five to 15 years in prison if they perform an abortion past the allotted pregnancy time frame.
Physicians in Kentucky who violate the law can face a Class D felony, which carries a jail sentence of one year or more. 
Not on party lines: When it comes to abortion, conservative women aren't a monolith
Last month, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed legislation that would ban abortion in the state should the U.S. Constitution be amended or U.S. Supreme Court overturn the Roe v. Wade decision. Several other states in the region have recently passed similar laws.
"With President Trump continuing to appoint conservative jurists and several active challenges moving through the courts, that day should not be far away," Lt. Gov. Randy McNally said in a statement.

Like several other states this year, Arkansas passed new abortion legislation. That bill is slated to become law in August.
“I think we handled it in a measured way this year that has the best chance of influencing the debate nationally as well as recognizing improvements that science has made in terms of viability,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson told CNBC.

After legislation was passed that restricted access to drug-induced abortions in 2014, Oklahoma's Supreme Court called it "unconstitutional," tossing out the bill this month.
In its ruling, the court said the bill placed a "substantial obstacle in the path of a woman’s choice and imposes an undue burden on the woman’s right."

Physicians who perform or attempt to perform abortions in the state must report them to the state's Department of Health.
Failure to do so after 30 days after conducting a procedure could result in a $500 fine. "Knowling or reckless falsification" of such a report can result in a misdemeanor charge.
Kansas' Supreme Court ruled last month that regardless of any future decision on Roe v. Wade by the U.S. Supreme Court, the state constitution protects a women's right to an abortion.
"The State may only infringe upon the right to decide whether to continue a pregnancy," the ruling said, "if the State has a compelling interest and has narrowly tailored its actions to that interest."

Failure to do so and report it to the medical care facility where the procedure is being conducted can result in a Level 8 felony.
Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts recently tweeted support for Alamaba's abortion law, which will become the most restrictive in the nation when it goes into effect later this year.

As several states pass "heartbeat" bills to outlaw abortions once a heartbeat is detected, Iowa's version of the bill from 2018 was struck down by a county district judge earlier this year.
In citing the state Supreme Court, Polk County District Judge Michael Huppert referred to high court's ruling that "a woman's right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy is a fundamental right under the Iowa Constitution."
