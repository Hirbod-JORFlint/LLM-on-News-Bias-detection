On this episode of The Federalist Radio Hour, Libby Emmons joins host Ben Domenech to discuss her son’s experience in the New York City public school system and how it pushes the left’s narrative of systemic racism and white privilege. Emmons is a senior editor at The Post Millennial and senior contributor at The Federalist.
Emmons argues that the public school curriculum accomplishes nothing in its teaching of white privilege other than discouraging children from hoping for change. Schools ought to promote ideas of kindness and equality rather than divide children by informing specific children of their inherent racism.
“Your parents are racists, and your grandparents are racists, and racism is passed down in white families,” Emmons said. “What are you going to do with that other than to feel like there’s nothing you can do about racism? That you can’t possibly be anti-racist. What are the options?”
