Mississippi is the last state with the Confederate symbol on its flag, Mississippi Today reported.
Confederate symbols have become a flashpoint in the protests that have sometimes turned violent and destructive.
Republican Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said residents voted "overwhelmingly" to keep the flag in 2001, adding he doesn’t plan to take any action himself to change the flag, according to WAPT-TV in Jackson.
"If and when Mississippians decide that they want to change the flag, and I think at some point they will, it ought to be the people of Mississippi," Reeves said.
In 2001, Mississippians voted 2-1 to keep the flag.
About a dozen lawmakers from both sides of the aisle met on Monday with the Speaker of the State House Philip Gunn, a Republican, to discuss changing the flag, Mississippi Today reported.
Gunn has been supportive of the idea in the past and said he would back a suspension resolution to consider changing the flag if there’s enough Republican support in the House.
Two-thirds of the state House would need to vote to suspend the rules to consider the resolution.
It would then go to the Senate and would eventually need to be signed by Reeves.
Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, who presides over the Senate, has said voters not lawmakers should decide the flag's fate, but several senators told Mississippi Today he could be receptive to the idea.
Under the resolution, the flag would be replaced by an alternate design created by artist Laurin Stennis that is currently an authorized vehicle tag.
