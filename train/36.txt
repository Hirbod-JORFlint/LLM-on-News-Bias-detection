Bangladesh has struggled to control the pandemic, leading to strict lockdown measures. Government officials were assured the funeral would observe social distancing rules.
Police were unable to handle the huge number of people attending the last rites. 
“We had repeatedly asked them to ensure social distancing. Announcements through megaphones were made in the area to that end. Despite all-out efforts from our part, it was not possible to maintain the social distancing rules,” said Additional Superintendent of Police Md Alamgir Hossain.
“The law cannot be enforced on tens of thousands of people,” Hossain said. 
As of Sunday, Bangladesh had 2,456 confirmed coronavirus cases, with 91 deaths.
