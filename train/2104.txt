On Tuesday, Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana questioned Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf as well as Health Secretary Alex M. Azar about the coronavirus outbreak. Kennedy wanted to know how soon a coronavirus vaccine could be expected, and Azar’s testimony contradicted Wolf’s.
Azar told Kennedy, “We could, within a year, have a vaccine. But we want to…. put multiple vaccine candidates out there. We have a million dollars of proposed investment in vaccine.”
Kennedy noted that ten minutes earlier, Wolf had told him that a vaccine could be expected in “a month and a half” — and Azar responded, “One could not develop a vaccine in a month and a half. That’s never happened in human history.”
Kennedy recommended, “Maybe you ought to talk to the secretary of Homeland Security before he spreads that too far.”
