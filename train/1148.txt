Title: The human cost of raising youth sports to a '$17 billion' industry

From travel commitments to coaches' salaries and equipment, the chance for kids to play can often come at an exorbitant cost; insight from Dr. Travis Dorsch, assistant professor at Utah State University and founding director of the Families in Sport Lab.
At the Time 100 gala, the gold medalist and World Cup winner Alex Morgan opened up about having Hollywood support her and her teammates.
“I think what’s happened in the last 10 years is that everything’s become professionalized,” said David Jervis, senior director of youth programs for the Red Bulls, a New Jersey-based professional soccer team — owned by the energy drink Red Bull — that operates youth and community programs and targets high potential talent. 
 
“In doing that, it’s raised the cost of participation,” Jervis told Fox News. “Kids from lower-income areas don’t always have the accessibility to the best facilities, to the best coaches and programs across all sports.” 
 
Under programs created by the Red Bulls, boys and girls as young as 10 have the chance to play soccer free of charge. The organization’s Open Soccer Program, for instance, serves underprivileged children whose families cannot afford the costly fees of privately-run clubs and programs.
“Each year we’ll identify 10 to 12 locations where we’ll provide free training, scholarships, and we’ll go into those communities and run soccer camps,” said Jervis. “It’s very rewarding for us and for those kids.” 

More and more little league players are getting injuries that were once only seen in the professional ranks. Dr. Tommy John explains the alarming trend on 'FOX &amp; Friends.'
“Do you always need to spend 3, 4, $5,000 for your child to play at the elite level? I think the answer is ‘no.’” he said. “I think when families spend more on the sport, it can increase the pressure on the kid to perform and get the results.” 
 
In San Diego, Calif., where year-round sports programs are common, Dr. Tommy John, a sports chiropractor, said parents will sacrifice everything — including selling a home or dipping into retirement funds — to afford elite training for their children. 
 
“I’ve heard of families changing cities,” John said. “I’ve heard of polls being taken on Facebook, like, ‘What’s the best baseball cities? Trying to look to where to relocate my 8-year-old.’”
