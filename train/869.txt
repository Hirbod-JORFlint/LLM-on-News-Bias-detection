Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee reacts to growing calls to defund police departments and former acting DNI Richard Grenell calling out 2020's political fight.
Instead, he explained he supports "conditioning federal aid to police based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness. And, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community and everybody in the community."

"Most of the cities where there is real trouble are completely run and have been for decades by Democrat mayors with liberal ideas," he added.
"It doesn't work. And, maybe they ought to wake up to that," Huckabee concluded.
