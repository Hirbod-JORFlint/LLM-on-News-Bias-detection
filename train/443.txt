After being seriously injured during her floor routine on Friday, Auburn Tigers senior gymnast Samantha Cerio has announced she is retiring from the sport. Cerio was injured while attempting to do a handspring double front with a blind landing during the Baton Rouge Regional. She suffered two dislocated knees and 'multiple torn ligaments.' An aerospace engineering major, Cerio already has a job lined up with Boeing in Seattle.
Cerio was reportedly screaming in agony on the floor and could be seen on video clutching both her legs in pain before she was tended by medical staff and athletic trainers.

The meet was delayed while medical workers put splints on both of her legs before carrying her out of the Pete Maravich Assembly Center to a standing ovation.
"What a wonderful, inspiring young lady. I have no doubt she will overcome this injury and go on to do amazing things," he wrote on Twitter.
In her Instagram post announcing her retirement from the sport, Cerio said she "couldn’t be prouder of the person" that gymnastics made her become.
"It’s taught me hard work, humility, integrity, and dedication, just to name a few," she wrote. "It’s given me challenges and roadblocks that I would have never imagined that has tested who I am as a person."
The team rallied around Cerio's injury, with the hashtag "#StickItForSam" before the regional final on Saturday night but ended up coming up short, finishing fourth.
Cerio's coach, who said her injury was "pretty tough to watch," said she was "a fighter."
"We couldn't have a better leader for this team," he posted to Twitter.
