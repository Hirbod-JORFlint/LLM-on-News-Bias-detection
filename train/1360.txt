President Donald Trump bragged on Sunday that the Republican Party has never been stronger or more united than it is now, even as his impeachment trial is set to begin in the Senate this week. 
Trump tweeted: 
I have never seen the Republican Party as Strong and as Unified as it is right now. Thank you!‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 19, 2020

More than a few of his critics were ready to step in with a fact-check. To dispute the strength portion of his claim, they noted the wave of GOP losses in local, state and national elections since Trump took office in 2017. 
And as for unity, Trump faces multiple major ad campaigns aimed against him, not just by Democrats but also at least two Republican groups: Republicans for the Rule of Law, led by conservative pundit Bill Kristol, and The Lincoln Project, spearheaded by conservative attorney George Conway ‚Äï husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway ‚Äï as well as GOP strategists Rick Wilson, Jennifer Horn, Steve Schmidt and John Weaver. Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci has also vowed to launch an anti-Trump PAC among Republicans.  
The GOP lost over 650 seats since you took office. You‚Äôre political cancer. https://t.co/yts1QvMzBZ‚Äî Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) January 20, 2020

I have never seen the Republican Party turn a blind eye to corruption, criminal behavior, and nepotism as they are doing right now under Trump. They‚Äôve become a mindless cult similar to Kim Jong Un‚Äôs followers in North Korea. Chairman Trump can do no wrong to them. Shameful.‚Äî Eugene Gu, MD (@eugenegu) January 19, 2020

I have never seen the Dems so strong, unified and committed to doing one thing!  Impeach and remove Trump, then vote the rest of the GOP traitors out of office.  Beware, hell hath no fury than the people you have screwed...‚Äî Hedy Salazar (@queeniema52) January 20, 2020
Well, when you force out everyone who is not loyal to the wealth & power of the Trump Family, it gets smaller, but more unified!‚Äî David Rothschild (@DavMicRot) January 19, 2020
