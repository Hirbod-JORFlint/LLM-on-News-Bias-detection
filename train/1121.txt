On this episode of The Federalist Radio Hour, comedian Ryan Long joined host Ben Domenech to discuss cancel culture within the comedy industry and Long’s perspective on the recent protests. Long’s work can be found in his podcast “The Boyscast with Ryan Long” or on his Youtube channel.


Long argued the hypocrisy of woke white women demanding change for women and transgenders has moved the political conversation far away from the original discussion of police brutality and racial equality. The left, more generally, has taken an issue that began with a specific need for change and escalated it to involve many unrelated, larger issues.
“It’s all about muddying the waters, making everything intersectional, and putting them at the forefront of whatever the movement is,” Long said.
