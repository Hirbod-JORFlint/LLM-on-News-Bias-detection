Donald Trump used his mighty Twitter platform to drum up business for his golf course in Los Angeles on Sunday.
U.S. deaths from COVID-19 neared 80,000, but the president didn‚Äôt tweet about that.
So great to see our Country starting to open up again! https://t.co/ceXFk4iWBX‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2020

Many were appalled. Besides demonstrating an astounding lack of sensitivity, Trump‚Äôs post highlighted his continuing conflict of interest between serving his business and the American people.
No tests are available for us. No tracing is being implemented. You have done nothing to make it safe for us to go out. The virus has killed 80,125 people so far, 2000 more will be dead by tomorrow.  But by all means promote your golf course‚Äî Mia Farrow (@MiaFarrow) May 10, 2020

Again, Trump is pimping his private businesses in his capacity as POTUS, a clear Emolument Clause violation, if not just a simple example of his rank corruption.‚Äî ·¥õ Ä·¥ú·¥õ ú ·¥° Ä…™·¥õ·¥á Ä (@WritesMore) May 10, 2020
