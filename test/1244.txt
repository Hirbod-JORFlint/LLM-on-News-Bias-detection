Trump attacking wind power is nothing new. But, as Jonathan Chait at New York magazine explained, the noise made by their turbines does not cause cancer.
Tweeters were quick to pile on Trump over his latest untruth:
Wind turbine noise causes cancer.There are entire internet communities that spend hours upon hours cooking up vast and complicated narratives where Donald Trump is a mastermind orchestrating world affairs. They edit videos. For hours.‚Äî Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) April 3, 2019

I am definitely not getting into the cancer thing (what?) but it was just 2 weeks ago that Danish researchers found no significant relationship between wind farms and heart attacks and strokes. https://t.co/putaQmGIqI‚Äî Maryn McKenna (@marynmck) April 3, 2019

1) President's ongoing attacks on wind energy (he says tonight that turbines cause cancer) infuriates supporters in big wind states like Iowa and Texas2) Trump has fought Scottish officials over turbines near his properties‚Äî West Wing Reports (@WestWingReport) April 3, 2019
The "wind turbines give you cancer" thing is such a deep cut in the conspiracy ecosystem, it's remarkable it navigated its way to Trump, who doesn't really use the internet other than to tweet.Whatever grapevine he heard this through must have some really wild stuff in it.‚Äî Ben Collins (@oneunderscore__) April 3, 2019
