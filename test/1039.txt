Title: AOC's 'concentration camps' claim was just tip of the iceberg -- Here are some of her most controversial comments

The freshman congresswoman lashes out about immigration crisis; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.'
That obviously didn't go over well with Amazon which blasted her allegations as "absurd." "Amazon associates receive industry-leading pay starting at $15 an hour," an Amazon spokesperson said, citing the pay rate AOC and other progressives sought to install as the federal minimum wage.
As part of AOC's emphasis on race, she has derided as so-called "colonial" acts that the alleged perpetrators don't even realize were oppressive. She warned, for example, that New Yorkers should be wary of blindly planting food like Cauliflower in the Bronx.
During a video, AOC addressed people who complained that planting Yucca -- a plant often found in Mexico and Guatemala -- was too difficult. Where they apparently saw an attempt to avoid cumbersome gardening, she saw a perpetuation of imperial conquest. “But when you really think about it -- when someone says that it’s ‘too hard’ to do a green space that grows Yucca instead of, I don’t know, cauliflower or something -- what you’re doing is you’re taking a colonial approach to environmentalism,” she said.
AOC's concentration camp comments weren't the first time she blasted the way children were treated at the border. During a long Instagram session in April, the New York congresswoman appeared to accuse Customs and Border Protection agents of forcibly injecting child migrants with drugs and putting them in cages.
Republicans might have felt a sigh of relief when AOC compared them to "Office" character Dwight Schrute -- at least she wasn't likening them to a demon. During that same Instagram session in April, AOC said Republicans' negativity reminded her of actress Linda Blair in "The Exorcist."
“The reason Republicans hate me so much is because I confront them directly on their moral — their lack of moral grounding on so many issues and, not just that, but the reason they're so upset and they act like that girl in 'The Exorcist’ that's like vomiting pea soup, that’s like them and negativity,” she said.
