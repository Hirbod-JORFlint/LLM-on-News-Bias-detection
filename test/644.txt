Title: Donald Trump said he 'learned a lot' from Richard Nixon

Content Text:
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Friday he has drawn historic lessons from an unusual source, none other than Richard Nixon – but then he quickly argued he hasn't followed all the examples of the only U.S. president to be forced to resign his office.
In a phone interview with the program "Fox & Friends," Trump said, "I learned a lot from Richard Nixon – don’t fire people."
Later in the interview, he went on to stress the differences between himself and Nixon. But Trump has fired people. His 2017 dismissal of FBI director James Comey became a big part of investigations into Russian influence on the 2016 presidential election.

Trump, who denied accusations that he fired Comey in an effort to cover up alleged cooperation between his campaign and the Russians, also said Friday Nixon made a mistake in firing a number of aides who wound up providing evidence against him.
Trump has also fired people who were under investigation over their possible ties to Russia. That group includes former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pled guilty to making false statements to the FBI; that case was dropped by Trump's Justice Department on Thursday.
In his Fox interview, Trump wound up stressing his differences with Nixon, including another denial that his campaign colluded with Russia.
"Number one, he may have been guilty," Trump said of Nixon. "And number two, he had tapes all over the place. I wasn’t guilty. I did nothing wrong, and there are no tapes. But I wish there were tapes in my case."
Critical historians found Trump's history a little off base, and said he should be emulating more successful presidents like Franklin D. Roosevelt.
"So he basically studied Richard Nixon so that he could learn how to get away with things," tweeted historian Julian Zelizer. "Wish he had focused more on FDR to understand how to fix things."
Aaron David Miller, a political analyst and author of The End of Greatness: Why America Can’t Have (and Doesn’t Want) Another Great President, said Trump should read up on other predecessors, such as Harry Truman.
"That Trump is invoking Richard Nixon – a president who undermined the  very constitutional system he was sworn to protect – to explain away his own efforts to subvert rule of law is really quite stunning," Miller said. "As Truman said about Nixon – he may have read the Constitution; but he didn’t understand it. Same might be said of Trump."
