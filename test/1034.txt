Title: Joe Biden Touts Gun Control that Doesn’t Stop Mass Public Attackers

Spotlight: In his ongoing effort to differentiate between himself and Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden is touting background checks but ignoring the fact they do not stop mass public attackers.

Content Text:
On Sunday night Biden tweeted:
Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady background check bill that has kept 3 million firearms out of dangerous hands, not once, not twice, but five times. 
We need a president who will stand up to the @NRA — not one who stood with them against lifesaving gun safety measures.

While Politifact reports Sanders “did vote against the Brady bill, including a shifting mix of background check provisions, five times,” Biden is not addressing the fact checks have proven to be no hindrance to determined, mass public attackers.
In fact, nearly every mass public attackers of recent memory–going back some 12 or 13 years–acquired his guns via a background check.
Here is a short list of attackers who acquired their guns via background checks:
The handful of mass public attackers who did not acquire their guns via background checks–attackers like the one who struck Sandy Hook Elementary School—got their guns via thievery, so no amount of point-of-sale gun control would have stopped them. This is important at a time when Democrats in the House and Senate, and the presidential primary race, are all pushing an expansion of background checks as crucial for American safety.
On February 18, 2020, Breitbart News reported a John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health study showing that expanded backgrounds do not reduce the mass shooting rate. Thus, whereas Democrats are fond of pushing even more background checks as a way of stopping future attacks, Johns Hopkins study found that expanded background checks are not “associated with lower rates of fatal mass shootings.”
