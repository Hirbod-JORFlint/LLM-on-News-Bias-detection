The House Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing Thursday at 10:00 A.M. Easter on how the tax code allegedly “subsidizes hate.”
Witnesses for the hearing include:
The hearing comes a day after the Democrat-led House held a hearing to discuss the alleged threat of white nationalist terrorism to the country.
During the hearing, Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) said President Donald Trump was to blame for the rise of white nationalism partly due to his labeling the migrant caravans as “invasions” and for suggesting that Baltimore, Maryland, was “rodent infested.”
