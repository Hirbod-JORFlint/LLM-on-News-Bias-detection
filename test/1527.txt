Stone continued: "We have to step up because this is war, this is a climate war, and for the first time, our enemy is not wearing a uniform that we'll be able to recognize. Our enemy is our own behavior."
The actress then calls for "corporate-wide, government-wide, systematic changes" to take place in order to combat climate change before telling viewers, "It's time to act."
"From the very privileged position of having been granted a green card for the USA I have decided it’s environmentally unjust to pursue a life across two continents," wrote Stone in the caption. "... This is my way of kicking off real 2020 change in my life. I’m aware it comes from a position of extreme privilege. Skin in the game."
Additionally, she explained that she'll be pursuing environmentalism work.
"I'm going to be here in Australia, doing the work I can to make a difference here, because the time is now," Stone said in the video. "Like I said, this is war, and we've got 10 years, so let's make these sacrifices, let's make these changes, let's put some skin in the game and say 'Yeah, I care and this is what I'm going to do about it.'"
She concluded: "This is just the beginning for me."
