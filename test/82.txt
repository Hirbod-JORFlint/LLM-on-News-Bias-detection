“I’m not going to criticize anyone who’s bringing their energy and voice,” she said. “That’s not my style. I think she’s elevated awareness and that’s a positive thing.” 
Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg addresses guests at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 
“My message is that we will be watching you,” she said. “This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here, I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean, yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you.” 
“So ridiculous. Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!” Trump tweeted. 
Speaking to reporters from Davos on Tuesday, Trump said he didn’t “really know anything about her” and described her as “very angry.”
