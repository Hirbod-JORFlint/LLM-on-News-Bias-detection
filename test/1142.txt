The spring campaign marks a dramatic shift toward progressive feminism for Victoria’s Secret, which has been roiled by management changes in the past year. The lingerie brand parted ways with owner Les Wexner in February after he got caught up in the Jeffrey Epstein pedophilia scandal.
Last year, chief marketing officer Ed Razek stepped down after giving an interview in which he said Victoria’s Secret wouldn’t use transgender or plus-sized models. His comments provoked a backlash in the fashion media, with some accusing him of misogyny and transphobia. Razek was also accused of sexual harassment by a number of models including Bella Hadid.
