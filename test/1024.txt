Former Vice President Joe Biden said Thursday 10 to 15 percent of Americans are just “not very good people,” during a virtual town hall on race. ‘
“Do we really think that this is as good as we can be as a nation? I don’t think the vast majority of people think that,” Biden said in an online event titled, “The Shade Room” moderated by actor Don Cheadle. “There are probably anywhere from 10 to 15 percent of the people out there that are just not very good people. But that’s not who we are. The vast majority of people are decent. We have to appeal to that and we have to unite people.”
While falling short of calling half the nation “deplorable” as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did in 2016, the comments echo a deep disdain for a large population of the country increasingly perpetuated by left-wing elites in the wake of the George Floyd protests characterizing the U.S. as irredeemably racist. Part of that campaign includes now branding every facet of American life around oppressing black people, from declaring the Second Amendment racist to the threat from the novel Wuhan coronavirus.
“The history of our country is not a fairy tale, it doesn’t guarantee a happy ending, but as I said earlier, we’re in a battle for the soul of this nation,” Biden said at the event that also featured Atlanta businessman Ryan Wilson. “It’s been a constant push and pull for the last 200 years.”
Biden’s comments also reflect the anti-American teachings of the New York Times’ “1619 Project” that the legacy paper is pushing on school curriculums attempting to re-write U.S. history as entirely evil and corrupt. Watch a short documentary debunking major claims from the project here.
