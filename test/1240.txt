President Trump says the Green New Deal would have a ‘devastating effect on the world’ at a news conference.
"The Green New Deal would kill our country," Trump said during a press conference at the White House. "The Green New Deal would have a devastating effect on the world and it's not going to happen anyway because it's impossible for them to do it -- if you ever look at what they want to do under the Green New Deal, it's like baby talk."
Several conservative studies have indicated that the plan, pushed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., would saddle households and the economy as a whole with unrealistic costs, as it seeks to drastically overhaul the nation's infrastructure and energy consumption.
Sanders, on his website, warned that without action on climate change, the U.S. will "lose $34.5 trillion by the end of the century." He also predicted savings as high as $70.4 trillion over 80 years by "averting climate catastrophe."
Multiple studies have attempted to translate the resolution's pledges into concrete policies, but often claim to significantly underestimate the actual costs due to the resolution's vagueness.
The Competitive Enterprise Institute released a study earlier this year showing that portions of the proposal would cost around $75,000 in average annual costs for households in key battleground states.
