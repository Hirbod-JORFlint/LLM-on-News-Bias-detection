“This bill will keep children safe from loaded, unsecured firearms. Like Gov. Northam’s other commonsense gun safety measures, it is something that everyone -- including responsible gun owners -- should support,” said Northam’s spokeswoman, Alena Yarmosky.

The bill is one of eight the Northam has proposed for adoption, drawing the ire of gun-rights activists nationwide.
Another measure that would ban so-called assault weapons like AR-15 rifles is also in danger of falling short. Some of Northam's gun control measures have passed in the state's Democratic-controlled General Assembly and lawmakers will hash out the differences between both chambers in the coming weeks.
Some of the bills include limiting handgun purchases to once a month; universal background checks on gun purchases; and a red flag bill that would allow authorities to temporarily take guns away from anyone deemed to be dangerous to themselves or others.
The rally went without incident.
