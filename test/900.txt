Sandmann to file lawsuits against 'as many as 13' others in viral video controversy; reaction on 'The Five.'
At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin was asked by reporters about Thunberg's call for countries to divest from fossil fuels, which he didn't exactly take too seriously.
“Is she the chief economist? Who is she? I’m confused,” Mnuchin jokingly replied. "After she goes and studies economics in college, she can come back and explain that to us."
That didn't sit well with one particular CNN anchor.
Critics on social media quickly reminded Cuomo about the attacks Sandmann faced by his network, which led to a major settlement earlier this month.
Others made the argument that Thunberg is fair game as a public figure, as she was Time's "Person of the Year."
Cuomo was actually part of the media pile-on against Sandmann last January, shaming the teen for making the "choice" of having a "standoff" with Native American elder Nathan Phillips, accusing Sandmann of displaying "disrespect."
"The kid, Nick Sandmann, he doesn't seem to be afraid, but he did make a choice and that was to make it a standoff. That was not a good choice," Cuomo said at the time. "If that were my son, who happens to go to a great Catholic school, would I like what he did? If I were there, would I have allowed the kids to be in that situation? No and no. There was a disrespect at play that doesn't work for me in these circumstances."
