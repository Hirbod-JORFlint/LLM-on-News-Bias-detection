The study, published in the scientific journal, Geophysical Research Letters, looked at 15 years worth of data from the government agency's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument over tropical oceans and noticed that extreme storms tend to occur more frequently over warmer sea temperatures.Â For every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit rise in ocean temperatures, 21 percent more storms form, the researchers found.
Extreme storms are defined as those that produce at least 3 millimeters of rain per hour over a 16-mile area.
By the end of the century, ocean surface temperatures may rise as much as 4.8 degrees Fahrenheit, assuming a steady increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, according to current climate models.
Though the study notes climate models are not perfect, they do help to provide a guideline for those looking to prepare for the changes, such as lawmakers and citizens.
"Our results quantify and give a more visual meaning to the consequences of the predicted warming of the oceans," Aumann added. "More storms mean more flooding, more structure damage, more crop damage and so on unless mitigating measures are implemented."
