A weeklong state of emergency has been called in the Australian state of New South Wales as deadly wildfires continue to ravage communities, forcing thousands from their homes.
At least eight people, including volunteer firefighters, have been killed by the fires in the eastern states of New South Wales and Victoria since Monday, officials have said. At least 17 have died since the fires began.
The emergency period begins Friday and marks the third time such a declaration was made since the fires began in November.
New South Wales Gov. Gladys Berejiklia told a press conference: "We don’t take these decisions lightly but we also want to make sure we’re taking every single precaution to be prepared for what could be a horrible day on Saturday."
