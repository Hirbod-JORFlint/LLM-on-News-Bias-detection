Title: White House staff to be tested daily for coronavirus after military aide tests positive

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump's his staff will be tested daily for coronavirus after a Navy valet who has been in close proximity to him tested positive for the disease.
Trump told reporters on Thursday that he has had "very little contact" with the valet. But during an appearance Friday on the morning program "Fox & Friends," Trump said the valet was in the same room with him on Tuesday, the day he began exhibiting symptoms.
Trump said he doesn't recall any direct contact with the ill employee, but that White House aides will be now tested daily for coronavirus instead of weekly. Officials would not say whether Trump himself will be tested daily.
"It's a little bit strange," Trump said, "but it's one of those things."
Both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence were given new tests after officials learned that the military aide had tested positive for the disease. Trump said he has been tested twice in recent days, with both tests coming back negative. Pence's test also was negative, administration officials said. 
The White House did not identify the infected person.

"We were recently notified by the White House Medical Unit that a member of the United States Military, who works on the White House campus, has tested positive for Coronavirus," said White House spokesman Hogan Gidley in a statement. "The President and the Vice President have since tested negative for the virus and they remain in great health."
CNN, which first reported the story, said that "Trump was upset when he was informed Wednesday that the valet had tested positive."
Trump said the valet had been off duty in the days before Tuesday. He told reporters Thursday the valet wore a mask, as many employees do.
In light of the aide's positive test, Trump said the valets who serve his food will now all be wearing masks. "They've already started," Trump told Fox.
Trump's announcement that staffers will be given a daily coronavirus test came a day after his spokesperson, Kayleigh McEnany, said it would be "nonsensical" to test everybody every day.
"If we tested every single American in this country at this moment, we have to retest them an hour later and then an hour later after that because in any moment you could theoretically contract this virus," she said. "So, the notion that everyone needs to be tested is just simply nonsensical. The people who need to be tested are our vulnerable populations."
