In August, one of them received a call from a family member who warned that his partner would be killed if they didn’t end their relationship, AFP reported. 
After that phone call, police asked the couple to come in for questioning, prompting them to flee Saudi Arabia, a country long known for draconian laws against homosexuality. 
The two men are now separated, with one in detention and the other being treated for tuberculosis in a hospital, while they await deportation, according to Battison. 
“Them speaking up is actually their right – there’s no reason we should remain silent about human rights abuses in Australia,” she said.
