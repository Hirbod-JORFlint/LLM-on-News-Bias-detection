Title: 'Women rising' but numbers falling: 2020 March tries to re-energize amid flagging enthusiasm

Content Text:
The 2016 election of Donald Trump as president so outraged large groups of women that they protested against him in record numbers the day after his inauguration.
Now the Women’s March is counting on his actions as commander in chief to energize a flagging organization.
Carmen Perez, one of the group’s original co-chairs, said there has been a surge in signups for Saturday’s marches since Trump’s decision to have U.S. forces strike and kill Iranian military leader Gen. Qasem Soleimani on Jan. 3, which led to an escalation in tensions that brought the countries to the brink of war.
“There was a moment in 2016, 2017, and I think that moment is here again,’’ Perez said. “One, we are in an election year. Two, we are in potential war conversations, with the fact the U.S. has struck another country. I personally feel we’re going to see an increase in numbers because people are wanting to come together again. People are going to show up to the Women’s March with their anti-war messaging because they want to be out in the streets working.’’
Perhaps, but organizers don’t expect Saturday’s protest in Washington, D.C. – the culmination of a week of events, with the slogan of "Women Rising'' – to draw more than 10,000 participants, a far cry from the estimated 100,000 who demonstrated despite chilly temperatures last year. The projections elsewhere are below past years as well. 
For the first march on Jan. 21, 2017, the Crowd Counting Consortium gauged the turnout in Washington at between 500,000 and 1 million, a staggering figure in a city of 710,000.
The crowd estimator pegged nationwide participation in the 650-plus sister marches that day at 3.3 million-5.3 million, making it the largest single-day protest in U.S. history. Those figures dwindled to 1.9 million-2.6 million in 2018 and 676,000-747,000 in 2019.
Some of the diminishing numbers can be attributed to protest fatigue, and perhaps Trump fatigue. But not all.
“With the reorganization of the Women’s March group, there’s been no discussion in D.C. at all really about the upcoming anniversary,’’ said Dana R. Fisher, a University of Maryland sociology professor and author of the book "American Resistance," which chronicles the activist movement to oppose Trump.
“They haven’t maintained the momentum, and they haven’t done a great job of continuing to connect with the individuals who have been their core activists.’’

The national organization was rocked in 2018 by accusations of anti-Semitism, compelling some civil rights groups to distance themselves. There has also been infighting and complaints of a leadership structure that was too top-heavy. Disagreements with and distrust of the New York chapter led to two competing marches being held in that city on the same January day last year.
In September, three co-founders – Tamika Mallory, Bob Bland and Linda Sarsour – stepped down as part of a restructuring that featured a more diverse board with 17 (now 16) members, including a rabbi.
The Women’s March has also revised its agenda, from a 10-point platform at last year’s demonstration to emphasizing three themes: reproductive rights, immigration and climate change.
The scope of the event in the nation’s capital is considerably smaller, and there is less focus on celebrities and more on grassroots organizers. The route for Saturday morning’s protest in downtown D.C. calls for starting at Freedom Plaza and walking the blocks surrounding the White House before returning to the point of origin.
“This year, we aren’t just marching. We’re putting our bodies on the line hand in hand with other mass movements,’’ the group’s website says.
Perez, who has denied the accusations of anti-Semitism that were most pointedly made against her and Mallory, said a member survey conducted last year prompted the changes in structure – more decentralized – and main policy themes.
She also points out that the Women’s March, for all its flaws, has sparked activism for other causes. The march was a factor in the Blue Wave that sent a record 102 women to the House of Representatives at the 2018 midterms, 35 of them winning a seat for the first time.

“I think the Women’s March has inspired so many moments,’’ Perez said. “Not only have we seen women run for office and get elected, but we’ve also seen young people rise up and been inspired by what they witnessed and how they participated in the Women’s March.’’
Fisher and other experts on social movements acknowledge the impact of the women's rallies, recognizing that momentous day three Januaries ago as the launching point of the resistance.
They also note the multiple offshoots that have grown from there, either because of disaffection with the Women’s March organization or a desire to advocate for other causes.
One of them is March On, which provides support and guidance to women-led groups throughout the country. It was founded by Vanessa Wruble, who was pushed out over differences with the leadership after serving as one of the main organizers of the first march.
Fisher said the emergence of a number of activist groups with no ties to the Women’s March serves as proof the steadfast groundswell against Trump’s policies continues unabated, with or without the influence of the organization.
“That movement is alive and well. But it’s not clear to me that the Women’s March group, the national group or the Women’s March as an annual event is playing a very big role in it at this point,’’ Fisher said. “There needs to be more of a hook, and right now it’s unclear what the hook is, except that it’s the fourth anniversary.’’
Longtime activist Megan Beyer looks at the impact of the Women’s March from the perspective of someone who has been involved in the pursuit of gender equality for decades, and has seen its intermittent progress. She recalls the day her young daughter asked when there would be a “girl president,’’ and openly calls Trump “a misogynist.’’
A former TV reporter who now does speaking engagements, Beyer is less interested in the head count at marches and more in where the cause is headed, which she says is the right direction.
“I think big things are happening. I say this as a woman over 60 who graduated from college in 1979,’’ said Beyer, who is married to U.S. Representative Don Beyer, D-Virginia. “I think women have never been more committed to equality and justice, and I think you’ll see that in the election.’’
