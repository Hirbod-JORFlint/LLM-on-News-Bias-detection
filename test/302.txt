Title: Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves: Abortions must be cancelled during coronavirus pandemic

Content Text:
Gov. Tate Reeves promised to take action against the state's lone abortion clinic if it continues to provide abortions during the coronavirus pandemic.
Reeves has worked for years to limit and end abortion in Mississippi. He told reporters at a press conference Tuesday that he considers abortion an elective and unnecessary procedure.
The Mississippi Department of Health has ordered all elective medical procedures and non-essential medical visits to be postponed as health care providers prepare for what could be tidal wave of coronavirus cases.
To Reeves, that means abortions in Mississippi must end.
"We're doing everything in our power, and have for many years, to make Mississippi the safest place in America for unborn children," Reeves said.
The state's top health official appeared less certain about the future of abortions in Mississippi.
"That's something I was not familiar with," said Dr. Thomas Dobbs, State Health Officer, during the Tuesday news conference with the governor. "And before I would make any comments, I think we have to review the situation a bit more."
That did not stop Reeves from vowing "additional action" if the clinic in Jackson does not stop performing abortions.
When asked what that "action" might entail, Reeves did not offer specifics.
"We'll take whatever action we need to to protect the not only the lives of unborn children, but also the lives of anyone who may contract this particular virus," Reeves said. "... I don't know any specifics, so I'm not saying they are currently operating. I just simply don't know ... We'll take whatever necessary actions."
Later, in a change of tone, Reeves appeared to downplay the politics of the abortion issue.
"The reason those elective procedures is shut down is not because we're trying to say anything other than we need to protect our (personal protective equipment), our masks, et cetera, and other supplies for anyone who gets infected by this virus," he said.
There were a few anti-abortion rights protesters outside the Jackson Women's Health Organization's clinic Tuesday afternoon. The facility, also called the Pink House because of the building's color, is the only place that offers abortions in the state.
The clinic is still open, according to Kelly Krause, spokeswoman for the Center for Reproductive Rights, a legal advocacy nonprofit that represents the Jackson Women's Health Organization.
Clinic staff are taking precautions to keep patients and staff safe, following recommendations from the state Department of Health, State Board of Medical Licensure and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Krause said in an emailed statement to the Clarion Ledger.
Abortion is an "essential, time sensitive" healthcare service, Krause said.
"(Abortions) must remain available during this pandemic — particularly because every pregnancy is unique and can pose significant health risks," she said. "Indeed, this pandemic highlights the absurdity of medically unnecessary restrictions on abortion care, such as requirements for in-office counseling that could be effectively done over the phone."
Krause added that patients should not have to drive "hundreds of miles to receive abortion care."
"What was once a substantial burden may now be a bridge too far given layoffs, school closings and restrictions on travel now in place in many areas," she said.
Laura Duran, president of Pro-Life Mississippi, an anti-abortion organization based in Jackson, claimed in a news release that sidewalk protesters report clinic workers "are packing people in their office and parking lot," including some with license plates from Louisiana and Texas.
"... We are concerned that individuals who have been exposed to COVID-19 are being packed into an office without regard to social distancing," Duran said in a statement.
Volunteers with the anti-abortion organization have filed complaints with the state Health department, mayor of Jackson, governor and state medical licensure board, Duran said.
