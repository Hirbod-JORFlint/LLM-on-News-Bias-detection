A report by a collaboration of The Trace and The New Yorker reveals the intricate way in which hundreds of millions of dollars have allegedly been siphoned off to top executives and vendors at the National Rifle Association (NRA).
The story was published on Wednesday and written by reporter Mike Spies, who viewed internal documents and tax filings and found that public relations firm Ackerman McQueen, which helps manage the NRA's image, was paid $40 million in 2017.  Ackerman McQueen has worked with the group since the 1970s.
"The NRA and Ackerman McQueen have become so intertwined that it is difficult to tell where one ends and the other begins," Spies wrote. He continued:
Reportedly, some of the NRA's payments that may constitute a conflict of interest pass through financial channels that intentionally obscure the recipients.
Law experts say this alone could threaten the NRA’s tax-exempt nonprofit status.
On Thursday, gun control activist Shannon Watts of Moms Demand Action said that Everytown, the parent organization of Moms Demand Action, had filed a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service.


"Based on this new article, @Everytown - the parent org of @MomsDemand - just filed a complaint about the @NRA’s tax-exempt status with the IRS, and is calling for federal and state investigations into the NRA’s operation as a charity," Watts said in a tweet.
