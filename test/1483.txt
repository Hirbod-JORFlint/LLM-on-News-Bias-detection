Major Garrett has covered Congress and four different presidencies for three news outlets. He is now Chief White House Correspondent at CBS and author of the book, “Mr. Trump’s Wild Ride: The Thrills, Chills, Screams, and Occasional Blackouts of an Extraordinary Presidency.” 
On this episode of the Federalist Radio Hour, Garett shares his experiences covering politics, how television and print media have changed, and his own account of the first year of the Trump presidency. 
“No data, I believe, before 2016 is in anyway relevant to what’s happening now,” Garrett said of the midterms. “The Trump effect is psychological on the pro and con side. It feels primal…so that brings with it forces in politics we can’t accurately measure.”
