WASHINGTON – Russia President Vladimir Putin joked Wednesday that he is going to interfere in the 2020 presidential elections.
During an appearance on a panel at Russian Energy Week in Moscow, Putin was asked by moderator Keir Simmons of NBC News whether Russia was going to meddle in the upcoming election.
“I'll tell you a secret: Yes, we'll definitely do it," Putin cheekily replied while cupping the microphone, according to a translation from CNN.
"Just don't tell anyone," he added.
Bloombergalso reported Putin's response.
U.S. intelligence, as well as the findings from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, found that Russia did meddle in the 2016 presidential election and have warned that they will likely do it again in 2020.

This isn't the first time Putin joked about election meddling. 
President Donald Trump in June briefly met with Putin on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. During a press conference, a reporter yelled out to Trump asking whether he will tell Russia not to meddle in the U.S. elections.
“Yes, of course I will,” Trump said.
Turning to Putin with smile, Trump jokingly said: "Don't meddle in the election, president."
"Don't meddle in the election," he repeated, wagging a finger at Putin. The Russian president smiled during the interaction.
