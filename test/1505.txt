Right-wing media — and the politicians desperate for its positive coverage — are frothing at the mouth with outrage every time Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortex (D-NY) of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) speak a single syllable. Clearly, as others have pointed out, they're seeking to do to the new freshman class of progressive congresswomen what they've done for decades to Hillary Clinton.
The main message conservative talking heads are trying to drive home is simple: Democrats are dangerous extremists, while Republicans are reliable. But as economist Paul Krugman argued in a new column for the New York Times, the exact opposite is the case.
While even the more left-leaning Democrats in Congress have reasonable views in line with public and expert opinion, the right-wing is completely off the deep end.
"Republicans, on the other hand, really are extremists," wrote Krugman. "As Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein put it in 2012 — long before the rise of Trump — the modern G.O.P. is 'ideologically extreme' and uninterested in 'facts, evidence, and science.' For example, major figures in the party routinely dismiss global warming as a hoax perpetrated by a vast global conspiracy."
Though conservatives try to demonize Ocasio-Cortez an Omar, their actual policy views are perfectly mainstream.  The New York lawmaker proposed a 70 percent tax on top incomes — a view backed by public opinion and many well-respected economists. Large majorities of both parties seem to like the Green New Deal, despite efforts by Fox News to paint it as disastrous.
Another instance, not mentioned by Krugman, of congruence between progressive policy and public opinion was inadvertently displayed in Fox News' town hall Monday night with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). When the hosts tried to suggest that Sanders' Medicare for All plan would be unpopular among people who already have insurance by polling the audience, they seemed surprised to find that the people in attendance absolutely cheered the idea of ditching their private plans for government coverage.
Omar has faced some criticized by both parties for remarks that some argued stirred up anti-Semitics stereotypes, but the conservative attacks on her have completely devolved into outrageous bursts of clear Islamophia and slander.
"It’s surely not an accident that these two principal targets are both women of color; there’s a sense in which supposed concerns about extremism are just a cover for sexism and white nationalism," said Krugman.
And while Democrats continue to push for policies that people actually want and that would make their lives better, President Donald Trump and the Republicans have largely failed in office. Their biggest legislative initiative, tax reform, has added to the public debt, failed to spur business investment, and become unpopular.
On Twitter, Vox's Matt Ygelsias noted that there is an important exception to Krugman's point.
"I think it’s important to say that the public has progressive views on economics *except on middle class tax increases* which is an important proviso when you’re designing your agenda," he said.
This does remain a perpetual challenge for Democrats and anyone hoping to push a more progressive vision for U.S. policy. It may be achievable, and it may make most people much better off, but popular resistance to raising taxes will create difficult frictions whenever major changes are proposed.
