The Daily Wire senior editor Ashe Schow and Fox News contributor Karl Rove react to Bernie Sanders' plan to reach out to voters.
As a self-described Democratic socialist, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has been outspoken about economic inequality.
Now that he’s running for president again, the 77-year-old continues to advocate for the poor and middle class, including appealing for a $15-an-hour minimum wage and tuition-free colleges and universities.
Back in 2016, Sanders was allegedly the 19th-poorest U.S. senator, The Washington Post reported. However, he has since published four books, and that's said to have helped make him a millionaire.
"I wrote a best-selling book," Sanders told The New York Times. "If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too." 
His returns also showed that Sanders only gave 3.4 percent of his adjusted gross income in 2018 -- though his statement said his returns don't account for the fact that all the proceeds from his book "The Speech" go directly to charity. 
Here’s a look at what else is known about the senator’s income and assets.
Those royalties included a $505,000 advance on his book "Where We Go From Here," which was published in 2018, Newsweek reported. 
In 1987, Sanders recorded a politically focused folk album through Todd R. Lockwood Works called "We Shall Overcome."
Sanders bought a third residence in 2016 -- a house on Lake Champlain in Vermont -- for $575,000, according to The Washington Post.
