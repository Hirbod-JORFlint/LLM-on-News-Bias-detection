President Donald Trump offered an unusual warning to Virginia farmers on Tuesday, suggesting that their potatoes might be at risk and they will need to be armed to protect those spuds.

Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) fired back on Twitter with a warning about the anti-malaria drug Trump is taking to prevent coronavirus infection despite the fact that it’s not approved for the disease:
I grew up on a Virginia farm, Mr. President—our potatoes are fine. And as the only medical doctor among our nation's governors, I suggest you stop taking hydroxychloroquine.Let's all get back to work. https://t.co/eay8saxcK1— Ralph Northam (@GovernorVA) May 19, 2020
Others soon joined in with their own quips about potatoes in need of armed protection:
Our potatoes? Are their armed people guarding potatoes in my state? https://t.co/xyssrmBTfJ— Rania Khalek (@RaniaKhalek) May 20, 2020

Trump's silly comments about armed Virginians guarding their potato fields is yet another sign that the administration's communications team is spuddering.— Gary Legum (@GaryLegum) May 19, 2020
Dearest- It's off to another long night guarding the potatoes. I am weary and long to close my eyes and dream of you. Alas, our governor is a wretched enemy of liberty and I must take up arms to protect the root vegetables. I miss you so.
