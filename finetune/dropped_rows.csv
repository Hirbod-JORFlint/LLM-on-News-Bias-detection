112,BBC Presenter Gabby Logan has said that it is not fair that transgender women can compete in sport alongside biologically female women.,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/MUn-1N_pc3I/,breitbart,sport,right,6,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"BBC Presenter Gabby Logan has said that it is not fair that transgender women can compete in sport alongside biologically female women.
Logan, who represented Wales in Rhythmic Gymnastics at the 1990 Commonwealth Games, said women’s sport needs to be “protected” and said many other athletes “feel the same way.” She stressed “This is not about attacking a community, it’s about saying: how can we make this a fair place for women to compete?”, reports the Mirror newspaper.
Her comments come as other famous sporting women including Sharon Davies and Martina Navratilova have spoken out against the unfairness of trans athletes competing against biological women.
British Olympic swimmer Davies said there were “fundamental differences” between the sexes and that it was not an example of a “fair and level playing field”.
She continued “I have nothing against anyone who wishes 2be transgender… However I believe there is a fundamental difference between the binary sex u r born with & the gender u may identify as. To protect women’s sport those with a male sex advantage should not be able 2compete in women’s sport.”
Meanwhile, Tennis Legend Martina Navratilova, a gay rights activist, wrote a column for the Sunday Times in which she said: “I am happy to address a transgender woman in whatever form she prefers, but I would not be happy to compete against her.” Navratilova added that it was “cheating”.
Their comments have faced serious backlash. One British sports columnist, Jonathan Liew of the Independent, said of the issue that it “falls under the most literal definition of transphobia: an irrational fear of the other, based on ingrained prejudice and occasionally pure ignorance”.
Rachel Mckinnon, a transgender college professor at Charleston College in the US, said that excluding trans athletes was like excluding black women “If Sharron Davies, Paula Radcliffe, or Martina Navratilova had said we need to keep black women out of sport to “protect it” and the “integrity of women’s sport that would be obviously racist. That’s why it’s obviously transphobic to exclude trans women now”
One school in the US has withdrawn from their athletic conference entirely over the issue. Grace Brethren Christian School Director George Hornickel stated that trans athletes competing as women was “a form of cheating” and that it “gives them an advantage over girls teams who only play female athletes.”","['fair', 'female']"

Phoenix’s Oscar speech for Joker was a rambling discourse that veered in several direction before settling on environmental platitudes.
“I think, whether we’re talking about gender inequality or racism or queer rights or indigenous rights or animal rights, we’re talking about the fight against injustice,” he said. “We’re talking about the fight against the belief that one nation, one people, one race, one gender or one species has the right to dominate, control and use and exploit another with impunity.”
The actor then bore down on animal rights, specifically the life cycle of a cow.
“I think that we’ve become very disconnected from the natural world, and many of us, what we’re guilty of is an egocentric worldview — the belief that we’re the center of the universe,” he said.
“We go into the natural world, and we plunder it for its resources. We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow, and when she gives birth, we steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakable. Then, we take her milk, that’s intended for her calf, and we put it in our coffee and our cereal, and I think we fear the idea of personal change because we think that we have to sacrifice something to give something up.”
Lena Dunham has publicly chronicled her weight struggles due to endometriosis and a romantic breakup. The Girls and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood star has posted scantily-clad images of herself on social media, including a photo last year of herself in lingerie to celebrate her weight gain and “big, generous, jiggly happiness.”

",https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/26/taking-student-debt-pursue-degree-consensual-choice/,federalist,student-debt,right,14,1,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Bernie Sanders floats a college debt cancellation plan sure to please many, but giving handouts to the wealthy and educated among us is deeply absurd.
Yesterday, one of presidential contender Bernie Sanders’ campaign lackeys tweeted out what should surely be considered one of the worst ideas of this election cycle.
This idea, gaining traction under the hashtag #CancelStudentDebt following the release of Sanders’ college debt forgiveness plan, is bad for several reasons, but naturally appealing in a sort of populist way, since plenty of people choose not to think about second-order impacts and potential consequences of driving our country into even more ruinous national debt than before.
For starters, Gautney, per her Twitter profile, is an associate professor of sociology at Fordham University, a private school located in New York City. None of this is a problem on its own; in a free society, people should be able to tweet whatever dumb things they want while working in whichever industry or field of research.
However, according to publicly available data, associate professors at Fordham make an average of $111,700 per year. This excludes the value of their benefits, so final compensation is a good bit higher. It’s worth noting that the vast majority of professors at Fordham fall into the “associate professor” or “professor” category (full professors make, on average, $159,800 annually). So, 486 of Fordham professors fall into these well-paid and elite categories, while 224 fall into non-six-figures categories (assistant professor, instructor, and lecturer titles).
In other words, living in New York City and making a hefty wad of cash each year isn’t so oppressive, and the majority of Gautney’s colleagues are doing alright. That aside, Gautney consented to this field, job, and city, so if she has an issue with compensation or cost of living, switching to a more lucrative field or cheaper place to live is a decision she should make for herself, not a decision that ought to be bailed out by unsuspecting taxpayers who played no role in the choice.

Sanders’ Grand Plan
Still, plenty of other people have greeted the Sanders plan with fanfare. If elected, Sanders would have taxpayers pay off the $1.6 trillion in student debt held by 45 million Americans. According to Washington Post, he’s “proposing to pay for the legislation with a new tax on financial transactions, including a 0.5 percent tax on stock transactions and a 0.1 percent tax on bonds,” which is a terrible idea in and of itself, as it would disincentivize investing.
What Bernie isn’t proposing to fix is the convergence of factors that lead to the high cost of college. Bailing people out instead of fixing deeper problems would be a foolish mistake. Colleges pump up their endowments and create bloated administrations, then expect students to grapple with enormous price tags.
But things don’t need to be like this: Mitch Daniels, president of Purdue University in Indiana, has frozen tuition at 2012 rates, so incoming freshmen in 2019 are locked into these cheaper prices. Currently, per Forbes, “In inflation-adjusted dollars, Purdue costs $4,000 less per year for out-of-state students than it did when [Daniels] took the job in 2013. In-staters pay nearly $3,000 less, at just under $23,000 this academic year for tuition, room, board and expenses.”
Daniels’ plan hasn’t been free of controversy, but it does make more sense than the current system:
In 2016 he introduced income-share agreements. Students who exhaust federal loans can fund their education with an agreement to sign over a share of their future income, usually between 3% and 5% for up to ten years after they graduate. (Repayments are capped at 2.5 times initial costs.) Critics hate ISAs because they’re unregulated and untested. Milton Friedman is said to have invented the idea but famously noted that they were ‘economically equivalent … to partial slavery.’ Daniels says, ‘If you want indentured servitude, it’s the student-loan program. With ISAs, the risk shifts entirely to the lender,’ since grads who don’t find work pay nothing.
Innovative practices aside, it’s up to consumers to exert pressure on colleges and hold them accountable for such wasteful, bordering on deceitful, practices. There’s no real reason why tuition costs must keep climbing.
Federal Spending Makes Student Costs Way Worse
We can’t pretend federally-subsidized loans don’t play a massive role. Even left-leaning outlets like Slate acknowledge this basic truth, drawing on data published in 2015 by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Brigham Young University:
Looking at both public and private nonprofit colleges during the mid-2000s, they found that schools raised tuition by 55 cents for each $1 increase in Pell grants their undergraduates received, and by 60 to 70 cents for each extra dollar of subsidized student loans. Why would this happen? As the Roosevelt Institute’s Mike Konczal points out, the answer is a little less obvious than you might assume—in a world of rational econo-bots, people aren’t supposed to willingly pay more for an investment, such as a college degree, just because they can get a loan for it.* But the reality is that there are still lots of 18-year-olds who will pay more or less whatever it takes to attend the college of their choice so long as they can find the cash. By letting students borrow more, the government may just be inviting schools to raise tuition, knowing kids simply respond by taking on extra debt.
Still, even with the widespread availability of such subsidized loans, the college debt crisis isn’t necessarily as bad as many claim, which is sure to be unpopular to those who feel like their burden is unjust. Reason’s Nick Gillespie writes, “According to data from Lending Tree, for instance, about 70 percent of the class of 2018 took out loans; their median monthly payment was $222. The average loan amount (which will be higher than the median) for graduates with debt was about $30,000.”
The debt load for those who pursue law or medical school will undoubtedly be higher, and might be stacked on top of existing debt incurred by undergraduate degrees. Still, those who pursue careers in legal or medical fields can look forward to massive returns; in these circumstances, there’s no real need for debt to be forgiven since this is the cost of entry into an ultimately higher-paying field.
For those who pursue advanced degrees out of boredom or difficulty getting a job, with no clearly mapped-out ROI, that debt should also not be forgiven. It’s not taxpayers’ fault that someone spent a lot of money she doesn’t have without a clear vision for how that degree could improve her later financial prospects.
College Admissions Counselors Have Bad Incentives
Then there are the social and cultural factors to consider: we currently have a system where college admissions counselors for high school students have no real skin in the game. If anything, their incentives are completely misaligned, even diametrically opposed, to the incentives of the students they’re supposedly helping. We should push back on this completely idiotic system we’ve created.
Parents and admissions counselors need to recognize that a small dose of tough love now will pay dividends later on. No student should bank on populist election-year whims bailing him out. Instead, parents and college counselors ought to have frank conversations with the students they’re shepherding into adulthood about fiscal responsibility and how student loan payments will factor into these students’ monthly budgets later in life.
There’s also the practical financial component: canceling debt would take $1.6 trillion. The money for this program, and the many others being proposed by the likes of Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, cannot be gotten from taxing just, say, millionaires over a certain threshold—especially since we’re hitting up those millionaire purses for every other thing on the agenda.
You can’t spend the same money twice, although every single Democratic presidential contender seems to be fruitlessly trying. So in order to have this scale of college debt bailout, we would need to tax significant swaths of the population, including a good number of middle- and upper-middle class earners. This sends a very clear message: we care about making the loads of relatively well-off students with decent financial prospects a bit lighter instead of helping much poorer Americans with fewer prospects.
That Sanders’ proposal lacks any sort of means-testing requirement makes it clear that he believes this is something all people deserve, but it’s unclear why, or how that’s a worthwhile investment given that it will be allocated toward those who are relatively rich (or could have been relatively rich had they not gotten a useless master’s degree that doesn’t translate into higher earnings).
""If we #CancelStudentDebt everybody can afford to go to college!"" Umm… *You* wanted to go to college. Others balk at the idea of 4+ years studying topics that bore them. They prefer the trades and starting businesses. Pay for your own preferences. — J.D. Tuccille (@JD_Tuccille) June 25, 2019
Even if all these other points are uncompelling to some, there’s a bigger, broader lesson to be learned here: why are we inviting more intrusion of other people into our personal lives? I think Gautney’s professional choices are foolish; they’re different than the ones I would make. The only reason I’m mentioning that is because she’s asked me, or people richer than me, to pay for these choices. Had she not, I’d have nothing to say about her career decisions.
The less intrusion into our private choices, the better, both for personal freedom and for creating a cohesive society that doesn’t feel it’s appropriate to cast judgment on the lifestyles other people choose to live. Feeling like we have to pay for other people’s foolish choices just breeds resentment, whether that resentment is warranted or not. So, the cost of this proposal is even higher than the already-flabbergasting $1.6 trillion.","['bailed', 'unsuspecting']"

305, Trade jobs such as electricians or carpenters are in demand and provide steady salaries. Policymakers shouldn’t deter students who know a good job when they see it.,https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/23/americans-need-to-stop-hurrying-young-people-into-student-debt-slavery/,federalist,student-debt,right,16,2,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Above all, we must give high schoolers personalized post-secondary educational recommendations before they get caught in the quagmire of student debt.
Americans crashed the Selective Service Agency’s website in early January because of a false rumor that signing up for federal student aid through FAFSA also meant signing up for the draft. Luckily, it turns out that 18-year-olds don’t have to go to boot camp when they apply for student loans. But they could be signing up for burdensome debt.
Student debt increased by a whopping 107 percent between 2009 and 2019. Americans now owe $1.6 trillion in education loans. Policy wonks and politicians respond by concocting flashy plans that hardly solve the debt crisis.
Debt forgiveness plans like Sens. Elizabeth Warren’s and Bernie Sanders’s will encourage colleges to increase their already pricey tuitions. Proposals to restructure repayment programs or dip into retirement accounts don’t prevent students from taking out dangerous amounts of student loans in the first place. We need to help students before they’re drowning in debt.
These ideas don’t address the root problem. They assume that all 18-year-olds benefit from a college education. But this assumption is wrong. Many high schoolers don’t know what they want to do with their lives. Others enter college unprepared. Parents, teachers, and other leaders need to encourage alternative options for these students. These students are the least likely to get well-paid jobs that will allow them to repay their college loans. This will leave them in a terrible financial trap.
It’s a trap because a college education doesn’t guarantee a good job. For years, the return on investment for higher education has steadily declined. More than 40 percent of recent college graduates are underemployed and work in jobs that do not require a college education. Underemployed graduates get stuck in such positions, drastically shrinking their lifetime earnings.
Given these bleak prospects, students who go to college to “find themselves” are likely to waste precious time and money because they lack a clear vision. Thirty-three percent of students change majors and 10 percent switch majors multiple times, which prolongs the completion time and cost of a bachelor’s degree.
College also exacts a high cost from students who lack sufficient academic preparation. Between 40 and 60 percent of high school graduates are placed into remedial courses during their first year of college. Many of these students drop out and never earn bachelor’s degrees. College drop-outs earn far less on average and are almost four times more likely to default on student loans than college graduates. Defaulters destroy their credit scores and damage their borrowing ability for a house or a car.
Parents, teachers, and other leaders should carefully note these trends and consider tailoring their career advice to each student’s specific needs. Most American policymakers say all students should attend college, but that’s a bad recommendation for unsure and unprepared students. Alternative paths to success exist.
Students without direction should first discover their strengths and interests through internships, apprenticeships, volunteer positions, or directly entering the workforce. Ideally, they should earn money while they “find themselves,” not borrow money in pursuit of a college degree that may not benefit them. These students would profit from putting off college until they know how they want to use the education.
Some high school students know they aren’t interested in college. Policymakers should support these students by encouraging them to attend a vocational school or enter the workforce. Trade jobs such as electricians or carpenters are in demand and provide steady salaries. Policymakers shouldn’t deter students who know a good job when they see it.
Some students want jobs that require a college degree, but aren’t prepared for the work. The worst choice they could make would be to spend or borrow money to attend college when they aren’t ready. These students should delay college enrollment until they are academically prepared. Students can study online, read books in public libraries, take remedial courses at community colleges—and, most importantly, work and earn money while they prepare.
Americans should, however, recommend students to attend college if they are ready and have a clear understanding of what they want to do with their education. Many lucrative careers require at least a bachelor’s degree, and these students should pursue college as soon as possible. But it’s not a good investment to encourage unprepared students to drift into debt slavery.
Policies that tighten loan eligibility requirements for college-bound students will discourage unprepared students from drifting into college. For example, federal student loan programs should be reformed to restrict eligibility to applicants with above-average high school GPAs and family incomes below 150 percent of the poverty level.
Above all, we must give high schoolers personalized post-secondary educational recommendations before they get caught in the quagmire of student debt. If we don’t, a whole generation of Americans will be sucked under.",['deter']
364," While conservatives may find comfort in the old saw that those who aren’t liberal at 20 have no heart, and those who aren’t conservative at 40 have no brain, the truth, as Levin knows, is that those who are statists at 20 usually end up statists at 40. And he’s not content to allow time to take its uncertain political toll. ",https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2015/07/31/mark-levins-plunder-and-deceit-takes-fight-to-millenial-generation/,breitbart,student-debt,right,19,1,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"In Liberty and Tyranny, iconic syndicated radio host Mark Levin laid out the stakes of the conflict between Constitutional Americanism and the forces of the statists—those who would see governmental power maximized in order to achieve the chimerical equality sought by the American left. In Ameritopia, he exposed the utopianism underlying the tyranny of the left, a utopianism with roots running back centuries. In The Liberty Amendments, Levin proposed constitutional amendments designed to rollback the perversions of the Constitution foisted upon Americans by those utopian statists.
Now, in his elegant and moving new book, Plunder and Deceit, Levin takes his message to the next generation. While conservatives may find comfort in the old saw that those who aren’t liberal at 20 have no heart, and those who aren’t conservative at 40 have no brain, the truth, as Levin knows, is that those who are statists at 20 usually end up statists at 40. And he’s not content to allow time to take its uncertain political toll. He wants young Americans to know the threats to their future, and he wants them to know those threats now—and he wants their parents to see the errors of their ways before it’s too late.
Levin’s Plunder and Deceit opens with a question not for young Americans but for their parents: “Can we simultaneously love our children but betray their generation and generations yet born?” he asks. The answer, Levin says, is no. We can pretend to ourselves that politics have no importance to the lives of our children, even as we engage as good parents. But that isn’t love, it’s moral cowardice:
To embrace the moral order as parents nurturing their children, yet to abandon the moral order as members of the ruling generation, thereby contributing to predictably deleterious public policies with prospectively calamitous outcomes, is a decadence that leads to unstable and potentially oppressive or even tyrannical contradictions which, in the end, degrade and disassemble the civil society and consume their children’s generation and generations beyond.
Meanwhile, young people are being seduced by utopian idealism at the expense of eternal values:
By cultivating agitation and balkanization almost nothing about the civil society is said to be true, right, or lasting and, therefore, worth preserving and perpetuating. Instead, much uproar is generated in the quest for utopian abstractions and societal transformation – the fundamental cause around which younger people have been encouraged and trained to rally, to their detriment and the jeopardy of subsequent generations, and to the benefit of the statist.
How do we counter the dual trends of parental abdication and youthful utopianism? Levin suggests truth as the weapon and then, armed with truth, resistance.
Levin begins his tome by writing about the crushing debt burden that young people will carry all of their lives thanks to the profligacy of their parents. That debt will take its toll in the form of rising interest rates, less investment, and a dramatically slowing economy. Debt, Levin writes, is a moral problem, not merely an economic one: “Stealing from the future does not establish the utopia promised by the statists. It is the rising generation’s grave moral failure.”
Levin extends that sort of clarity to his examinations of Social Security (“economically and fiscally irrational and irresponsible,” a program destined to take down “the older recipients and the younger payers alike”); Medicare and Obamacare (“simultaneously expanding and imploding”); modern American education (“administrators and educational bureaucrats, labor unions, tenured educators, improvident construction projects, and statist indoctrination”); immigration (“immigration without assimilation and Americanization undercuts the civil society as ethnic, racial and religious groups self-segregate”); climate change (“hysterical doomsday predictions of environmental Armageddon, which can only be avoided by the imposition of [environmentalists’] severe, ideologically driven agenda”); minimum wage (“the consequences… include pervasive unemployment and the lack of important job experience”); national security (“too many younger people are inattentive to or nonplussed about – or in rancorous opposition to – the development and maintenance” of strong national defense).
Finally, Levin comes to the Constitution. The bedrock document upon which the nation was founded has taken a heavy beating from President Obama and statists for decades; Levin looks to it as a guidebook from our current predicament rather than a beloved relic to be worshipped as a museum piece. The Constitution, Levin writes, “provides the governing order of a republic intended to protect the individual’s liberty from a tyrannical centralized authority and, conversely, the anarchy of mob rule.” But the document requires an informed citizenry to utilize it: “The citizenry must be alert and resolute and ensure that those who hold high office uphold the rules of governance.”
The people, however, have failed in their duty to uphold the Constitution, Levin says. Levin poses the battle as one between defenders of the Constitutional republic and statists informed by the spirit of Marx. And the Marxists are winning, gradually reducing the American people to a state of soul-sucking apathy and servitude.
Levin, rightly, blames Congress, which was supposed to be the lawmaking branch. His stunning comparison between the number of pages of federal regulations for 2014 (79,066) and number of actual regulations (3,541) versus the number of laws passed by Congress (129) demonstrates the increased power of the executive branch at the expense of the legislature. The statist vision is coming to pass in real time. And if the members of the younger generation continue to allow statists to plunder and deceive them, “they will commit future generations to an even more miserable plight.”
Levin responds to that threat by calling for a “new civil rights movement,” focused on the complete overhaul of education, immigration policy, Medicare and Obamacare, and all the rest. The new civil rights movement, says Levin, must “speak out, challenge, debate, rally, and protest. It must become a force for respectful and prudential activism. And when circumstances are unjust or oppressive, it must even disobey – but in a civil and peaceful way, unlike the violent and destructive rage of the 1960s radical underground movement and its modern adherents.”
“The right cause,” Levin concludes, “now is nothing short of self-preservation.” This is a battle for our lies and the lives of our children. It’s time to engage.

The professor, author of The Ahuman Manifesto: Activism for the End of the Anthropocene who describes herself as an “old school goth,” says that the only way to save the planet is to stop having children and allow humans to become extinct.
According to the official description of the book, MacCormack “actively embraces issues like human extinction, vegan abolition, atheist occultism, death studies, a refusal of identity politics, deep ecology, and the apocalypse as an optimistic beginning.”
Due to global overpopulation, giving birth is the worst thing you can do to the planet, MacCormack sustains, while insisting that she is not advocating wiping out the existing population but rather letting it die off.
“Far from advocating mass death, genocide or eugenics, my manifesto is antinatalist,” says MacCormack. “It boycotts human reproduction due to the damage humans have perpetrated on the Earth and its other inhabitants.”
“The manifesto simply asks that humans no longer reproduce – no life is lost, no being is mourned,” she states. “If we no longer reproduce, we can care for all inhabitants already here, human and non-human, as well as care for the Earth itself by mitigating the damage already caused. It’s an activism of care.”
A native Australian, MacCormack says her opinions have been manipulated and misunderstood.
“I simply propose people not reproduce, and it automatically translated into acts of violence,” she has said.
“So, somehow, I want to kill children, which is ridiculous. Somehow, I’m proposing eugenics or some kind of ethnic population control,” she declares, “and I think that what that shows is there is an anthropocentric — or a human — impulse to read acts of grace as, automatically, acts of violence.”
“And that says a lot more about the people not reading the book and just taking over the message,” she states.
MacCormack, who moonlights as a London DJ, said that her position can be “triggering” because it forces people to confront an idea that contradicts their fundamental view of the world.
Along with her opinions regarding the human population, MacCormack advocates overcoming “human privilege” through what she calls “abolitionist veganism,” or the notion that no sentient being should be treated as property of another.
According to MacCormack, her manifesto “questions the value of human exceptionalism, asking are humans really the ‘best’ forms of life, or should we dismantle our understanding of life as a hierarchy for a more ecological, interconnected scheme of living things?”
“There are people living in the apocalypse right now — especially non-human animals — who have born into an apocalypse. They live to suffer and then they’re murdered,” she said.
Among other climate action groups, MacCormack says that those like the protest group Extinction Rebellion have the right idea but are not going far enough.
“Even Extinction Rebellion only focus on the effect this will have on human life, when climate change is something that will affect every living being on the planet,” she states.
Anglia Ruskin University holds up MacCormack’s ideas on climate, but also underscores her expertise in feminism, queer theory, posthuman ethics, animal studies, and horror films.
“Currently she is working on a new impact case study on inclusivity in mental health and criminal justice especially in relation with issues of sexual difference and Trans rights,” the university website reads.

In an article posted by NBC News on Monday, the AP argues that even erstwhile allies, like tennis great and gay activist Martina Navratilova, can become resentful of transgender women dominating their sport.
The AP wrote:
Exhibit A is a recent public exchange involving tennis great Martina Navratilova, who came out as a lesbian in 1981 and is a longtime gay-rights activist. She now stands accused of being “transphobic” after asserting that many transgender women — even if they’ve undergone hormone treatment — have an unfair advantage over other female competitors. ‘A man can decide to be female, take hormones if required by whatever sporting organization is concerned, win everything in sight and perhaps earn a small fortune, and then reverse his decision and go back to making babies if he so desires,’ Navratilova wrote in a Feb. 17 op-ed for The Sunday Times of London. ‘It’s insane and it’s cheating.’ Supporters of trans inclusion in sports were aghast. One advocacy group, Athlete Ally, ousted Navratilova from its advisory board and said she would no longer be designated one of its ambassadors. ‘Trans women athletes aren’t looking to take over women’s sport,’ Athlete Ally said. ‘They are women and want to compete in the sport they love, just as any other athlete would.’
Though, whether transgender women (biological males) intend to take over women’s sports or not. The fact of the matter is that’s exactly what’s happening. Transgender female runners took first and second place recently, in the Connecticut track and field championships.
Much to the dismay of natural born female competitors like Selina Soule, who believe that male competitors make the competition feel rigged.
“We all know the outcome of the race before it even starts; it’s demoralizing,” biologically female teen runner Selina Soule said. “I fully support and am happy for these athletes for being true to themselves. They should have the right to express themselves in school, but athletics have always had extra rules to keep the competition fair.”
In addition, a 6-3 250 pound Australian handball player named Hannah Mouncey — a biological male — is the most physically dominating force in that sport.
However, according to champion transgender track cyclist Rachel McKinnon, the notion that transgender women will come to dominate women’s sports, is an “irrational fear.”
“No such thing will ever happen,” McKinnon wrote. “This is an irrational fear of trans women.”
LGBTQ-rights activist Helen Carroll, believes there’s a hypocrisy in the criticism of trans athletes. Chiefly, that people seem okay with trans athletes as long as they are losing. Though, if the trans athletes are winning, only then do people really start to care.
“As long as trans people are losing and are not the best, everything is OK,” Carroll said. “As soon as they start winning, that’s when the vitriol comes out about how they’re really still a man.”
As an example of this resentment, the AP uses the victory of trans woman mountain biker Michelle Dumaresq, who won the national title in 2006. As the AP writes, “second-place finisher Danika Schroeter donned a T-shirt provided by her boyfriend during the medal ceremony. It read: “100% Pure Woman Champ.
“Dumaresq later told The National Post, a Canadian newspaper, ‘That was the moment I stopped loving the sport. … That kind of wrecked it for me.’
The article even took aim at Breitbart, for accurately reporting the biological gender of transgender female cyclist Rachel McKinnon, after winning a track cycling championship in October.
Breitbart.com headlined its story, ‘Biological Man Wins Women’s World Cycling Championship,’ helping to trigger an avalanche of social-media attacks against McKinnon. ‘I’m immensely proud of my accomplishment,’ McKinnon wrote a few days later. ‘But not all of it has been positive. … I’d say the negative comments have outweighed the positive by about 3,000 to one.’
Of course, the Breitbart headline cannot be factually disputed. Nor, for that matter, can the Associated Press headline. Resentment does exist, in some cases, for transgender female athletes. However, much of that resentment is coming from women. Who, at least until recently, the ideological left had at least pretended to care about.
Was feminism and the advancement of women’s participation in sports just a passing fad? Did it go out of style? Exactly when and where did feminism lose the intersectional war with transgender rights?
Moreover, when did the left abandon the principles of science and fairness?
Democrat politicians have never shied away from reminding Americans of all the unfair practices that keep women from having success in the workplace. Yet, now that women are facing far more unfairness in the world of sports, not only does the left act as though the unfairness doesn’t exist, but cheers it on? What could be more anti-woman than actively rooting for an competitive arrangement where women are doomed to fail?
For whatever reason, it appears that the ideological left has abandoned women at the altar.

445,"On Tuesday, AOC once again ignited a media firestorm when she continued bashing President Trump's administration by alluding to Nazi Germany while describing the way Trump detained migrant families on the border.",,fox-news,immigration,right,23,1,Biased,No agreement,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has only been in Congress for a matter of months, but in that short period of time she's been able to prompt widespread outrage and catch the attention of some of America's most prominent politicians.
The self-described Democratic Socialist has attracted criticism and surprise over controversial policies like the ""Green New Deal,"" as well as her unorthodox political views that seemed to stun people on both sides of the aisle.
On Tuesday, AOC once again ignited a media firestorm when she continued bashing President Trump's administration by alluding to a term used to describe the horrific conditions Jews endured during the Holocaust. Here's a review of that comment and the many others that seemed to lead one pundit to dub her ""the most powerful Democrat in office.""
TOMI LAHREN: ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ IS RIGHT ABOUT THIS (YES, I MEAN IT)...
Labeling Trump's migrant centers 'concentration camps'
In what were perhaps her most controversial comments to date, AOC alluded to Nazi Germany while describing the way Trump detained migrant families on the border. ""The fact that concentration camps are now an institutionalized practice in the land of the free is extraordinarily disturbing,"" she said during a livestream that went viral on social media.
Her comments quickly caught the attention of her colleague, House GOP Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. Cheney, among others, suggested that the freshman congresswoman was grossly ignorant of history and disrespected Jews by bringing up a term often used to describe their imprisonment under the Nazis.
But Ocasio-Cortez and many others suggested her comments weren't outrageous because ""concentration camps"" were markedly different than the ""death camps"" that Holocaust victims experienced. Some weren't buying it, though, and Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Mark Morgan -- whose agency is partially responsible for detaining migrants -- even weighed in, calling her comments ""reckless, irresponsible, misinformed and wrong.""
AOC ATTACK GROUP TARGETS TOP DEM -- WHO VOTED WITH HER 96% OF THE TIME BUT CRITICIZED OMAR
The world will end in 12 years because of climate change
AOC started her congressional term with a bang -- proposing a multitrillion-dollar plan that would radically alter the economy with the goal of reducing carbon emissions. Initially dismissed as absurd by critics, her ""Green New Deal"" eventually made its way into Democratic presidential candidate's official policies.
While decrying the impacts of climate change in January, AOC seemed to conjure the most frequent conservative criticism of progressives on the issue -- namely, that they blow the threat way out of proportion. AOC not only invoked World War II, but suggested that the world would ""end in 12 years."" “Millennials and people, you know, Gen Z and all these folks that will come after us are looking up and we’re like: ‘The world is gonna end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change and your biggest issue is how are we gonna pay for it?'"" she said.
Her comments received widespread ridicule, although two-thirds of Democrats shared that view. Months after her comments, she derided Republicans for failing to recognize the ""dry humor + sarcasm"" in her statement. ""But the GOP is basically Dwight from The Office so who knows,"" she tweeted.
REP. MCCARTHY: OCASIO-CORTEZ OWES THE COUNTRY AN APOLOGY FOR CONCENTRATION CAMP REMARKS
Amazon pays its workers 'starvation wages'
As a ""Democratic Socialist,"" AOC has joined her colleagues -- Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., -- in fiercely criticizing big corporations for their purported greed and oppression of working class Americans.
In June, the freshman congresswoman doubled down on her previous criticism of one of the biggest U.S. corporations -- online retail giant Amazon -- and claimed CEO Jeff Bezos was able to make billions in part because he paid his workers ""starvation wages.""
That obviously didn't go over well with Amazon which blasted her allegations as ""absurd."" ""Amazon associates receive industry-leading pay starting at $15 an hour,"" an Amazon spokesperson said, citing the pay rate AOC and other progressives sought to install as the federal minimum wage.
ELIZABETH WARREN PROPOSES BREAKING UP BIG TECH GIANTS, INCLUDING AMAZON AND GOOGLE
Cauliflower isn't just something you grow in a garden -- it's an outgrowth of colonialism
As part of AOC's emphasis on race, she has derided as so-called ""colonial"" acts that the alleged perpetrators don't even realize were oppressive. She warned, for example, that New Yorkers should be wary of blindly planting food like Cauliflower in the Bronx.
During a video, AOC addressed people who complained that planting Yucca -- a plant often found in Mexico and Guatemala -- was too difficult. Where they apparently saw an attempt to avoid cumbersome gardening, she saw a perpetuation of imperial conquest. “But when you really think about it -- when someone says that it’s ‘too hard’ to do a green space that grows Yucca instead of, I don’t know, cauliflower or something -- what you’re doing is you’re taking a colonial approach to environmentalism,” she said.
“That is why a lot of communities of color get resistant to certain environmentalist movements because they come with the colonial lens on them.” Those comments seemed to foreshadow AOC's later claim that people were perpetuating ""the legacy of colonization"" when they pushed for Puerto Rican statehood.
MAN BREAKS INTO AOC'S OFFICES IN NYC, SPRAYS COPS WITH FIRE EXTINGUISHER
Border agents are caging children and injecting them with drugs
AOC's concentration camp comments weren't the first time she blasted the way children were treated at the border. During a long Instagram session in April, the New York congresswoman appeared to accuse Customs and Border Protection agents of forcibly injecting child migrants with drugs and putting them in cages.
“At least I’m not trying to cage children at the border and inject them with drugs,” she told viewers. “That’s not a mistake. That is a deliberate policy to attack people based on their national origin. That’s not a mistake, that’s just hatred. That’s just cruelty. That’s just wrong!” She seemed to be referring to an earlier lawsuit claiming migrant children were forced to take psychotropic medication.

GOP acts like a demon-possessed girl vomiting pea soup
Republicans might have felt a sigh of relief when AOC compared them to ""Office"" character Dwight Schrute -- at least she wasn't likening them to a demon. During that same Instagram session in April, AOC said Republicans' negativity reminded her of actress Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist.""
“The reason Republicans hate me so much is because I confront them directly on their moral — their lack of moral grounding on so many issues and, not just that, but the reason they're so upset and they act like that girl in 'The Exorcist’ that's like vomiting pea soup, that’s like them and negativity,” she said.","['ignited', 'firestorm', 'bashing', 'alluding', 'Nazi', 'Germany']"
644,Lawmakers specifically said they want to protect women from facing unfair competition from men who claim to be transgender women.,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/D3lET1ZN_LM/,breitbart,sport,right,33,1,No agreement,No agreement,"Republican legislators in five states are drafting legislation to prevent men and women in high schools from participating in sports based on gender identity rather than their biological sex.
Lawmakers specifically said they want to protect women from facing unfair competition from men who claim to be transgender women.
The Wall Street Journal reported on the development:
The bills—introduced or prefiled in New Hampshire, Washington, Georgia, Tennessee and Missouri—reflect growing attention around the issue of whether transgender-rights protections are leading to unfair competition in women’s sports. Policies regulating the eligibility of transgender high-school athletes are usually set by school associations and vary. In about a third of states, transgender students can freely compete on teams of the gender they identify with, according to transathlete.com, which tracks athletics policies nationwide. Like the National Collegiate Athletic Association, some high-school associations allow transgender females to participate on girls’ teams if they meet certain conditions, such as completing a period of testosterone-suppression treatment or gender-reassignment surgery.
But several states do not have formal guidelines addressing this issue.
The Wall Street Journal reported that the bills apply to high school students, so they don’t conflict with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) guidelines, which allow transgender female athletes to compete on women’s college teams after completing a year of testosterone-suppression treatment.
The lawmakers cite advantages that males competing as transgender women have over biological females, including differences in muscle mass, bone strength, lung capacity, and heart size — all differences that cannot be changed by hormone therapy or surgery.
The Wall Street Journal reported:
Critics say the legislation is unnecessary and could raise constitutional concerns about due process and discrimination. Lawmakers interviewed said they couldn’t point to eligibility disputes in their own states, but cited examples elsewhere such as in Connecticut, where two transgender female high-schoolers recently dominated the state’s girls indoor track championships.
The Alliance Defending Freedom filed a complaint last year with the U.S. Department of Education on behalf of three female high school athletes challenging Connecticut’s transgender athletic policy.
“I’m just trying to maintain fairness,” said Rep. Bruce Griffey (R-TN), sponsor of a trans-athlete bill. “I don’t want girls to be at a disadvantage.”
Griffey’s bill would prevent public funding to schools that allow athletics participation based on students’ declared gender identity as opposed to a student’s biological sex at birth and would impose fines on school officials who don’t comply with the law.
The Wall Street Journal interviewed a “transgender attorney” with the American Civil Liberties Union about the trend. Chase Strangio said the laws would discourage transgender children from taking part in competitive sports.
“I think it will be the year of the trans-athletes bills in the way that 2016 was the year of the trans-bathroom bills,” Strangio said.
The Wall Street Journal reported on a bill in New Hampshire that says school-sponsored sports and teams designated for women “shall only be open to students of the female sex.”
“It states that a disqualified student can prove she is female by submitting a physician-signed statement attesting to the student’s reproductive anatomy, testosterone levels and sex chromosomes,” the Wall Street Journal reported.

Or the thought of artificial cow insemination. Because after years of openly struggling with her weight (and health) and a seemingly self-imposed sabbatical from political lectures after backing Hillary Clinton in ’16, actress Lena Dunham announced to the world that it was Joaquin Phoenix’s unhinged Oscars tirade on the environment that has made her want to become vegan.
Welp, it finally happened- I do believe Joaquin Phoenix made me vegan. https://t.co/qpRbsdE3h7 — Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) February 10, 2020
Phoenix’s Oscar speech for Joker was a rambling discourse that veered in several direction before settling on environmental platitudes.
“I think, whether we’re talking about gender inequality or racism or queer rights or indigenous rights or animal rights, we’re talking about the fight against injustice,” he said. “We’re talking about the fight against the belief that one nation, one people, one race, one gender or one species has the right to dominate, control and use and exploit another with impunity.”
The actor then bore down on animal rights, specifically the life cycle of a cow.
“I think that we’ve become very disconnected from the natural world, and many of us, what we’re guilty of is an egocentric worldview — the belief that we’re the center of the universe,” he said.
“We go into the natural world, and we plunder it for its resources. We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow, and when she gives birth, we steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakable. Then, we take her milk, that’s intended for her calf, and we put it in our coffee and our cereal, and I think we fear the idea of personal change because we think that we have to sacrifice something to give something up.”
Lena Dunham has publicly chronicled her weight struggles due to endometriosis and a romantic breakup. The Girls and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood star has posted scantily-clad images of herself on social media, including a photo last year of herself in lingerie to celebrate her weight gain and “big, generous, jiggly happiness.”
The Girls star garnered headlines last March when she posted a video of herself breaking up with her scale.
Watch below:
Dunham has also posted nude photos of herself, such as the one last year in which she encouraged people to love themselves more.

In its report, Variety wrote that Joaquin Phoenix was “true to his mysterious ways, [and] carried around a big plastic bottle of water.”
The Joker star made headlines earlier in the night in a wild political rant.
“Whether we’re talking about gender inequality or racism or queer rights or indigenous rights or animal rights, we’re talking about the fight against the belief, one nation, one race, one gender or one species has the right to dominate, control and use and exploit another with impunity,” Joaquin Phoenix said. “I think that we’ve become very disconnected from the natural world and many of us, what we’re guilty of is an egocentric world view, the belief that we’re the center of the universe.”

“I think we’ve become very disconnected from the natural world. … We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow, and then we take her baby. … Then we take her milk and put it in our coffee and our cereal,” Phoenix said. “I think we fear the idea of personal change, because we think we have to sacrifice something, to give something up. But human beings at our best are so inventive and creative and ingenious, I think that when we use love and compassion as our guiding principles, we can create, develop and implement systems of change that are beneficial to all sentient beings and to the environment.”
In January, Phoenix was arrested at a “climate change” protest led by actress Jane Fonda in Washington, D.C. He invited Americans to stop consuming animal products to combat “climate change.”
Phoenix claimed, “The meat and dairy industry its the third leading cause of climate change and I think sometimes we wonder what can we do in this fight against climate change, and there’s something you can do today, right now, and tomorrow by making a choice about what you consume.”
Despite framing consumption of fossil fuels as a driver of “climate change,” Phoenix admitted to having flown to join the protest in the nation’s capital. The event’s organizers endorsed the Green New Deal, calling for an end to use of fossil fuels.
Other left-wing narratives pushed by Phoenix include critiques of the entertainment industry’s “systemic racism” and “gender inequality.”
Hollywood celebrities have procured speechwriting services from agencies run by political operatives who previously worked for Democrat figureheads such as Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, according to a February-published report.

865,This would be the same Taliban that gleefully murders young women for the crime of going to school and regards democracy as a crime against Islam punishable by death.,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/EReXUAKj_UQ/,breitbart,international-politics-and-world-news,right,44,1,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The New York Times on Thursday published an op-ed written by Sirajuddin Haqqani, deputy leader of the Taliban and a globally designated terrorist with a $5 million FBI reward on his head.
Haqqani used the opportunity extended by the Times to recite Taliban propaganda and lay out the terrorist organization’s terms for peace in Afghanistan.
The FBI wants Haqqani for “questioning in connection with the January 2008 attack on a hotel in Kabul, Afghanistan, that killed six people, including an American citizen.” He is also wanted for participating in attacks on U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan and planning the attempted assassination of former Afghan President Hamid Karzai in 2008.
Haqqani is not only deputy commander of the Taliban but also the operational commander of the Haqqani Network, the infamous criminal gang and internationally designated terrorist organization allied with the Taliban that is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks and kidnappings, including U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl. Sirajuddin Haqqani’s father Jalaluddin, founder of the network, died after a long illness several years ago.
The New York Times did not see fit to provide any of this background information to readers, identifying Sirajuddin Haqqani as merely “deputy leader of the Taliban.”
In his op-ed, Haqqani portrayed the Taliban as reasonable negotiators appalled by the loss of life in Afghanistan, excusing his group’s atrocities and remorseless attacks on civilians as justified acts of self-defense. He blamed the United States for undermining previous efforts at working out a peace deal.
“We did not choose our war with the foreign coalition led by the United States. We were forced to defend ourselves. The withdrawal of foreign forces has been our first and foremost demand. That we today stand at the threshold of a peace agreement with the United States is no small milestone,” Haqqani wrote.
The terrorist leader claimed that his side stuck with the current round of negotiations despite “the intensified bombing campaign against our villages by the United States and the flip-flopping and ever-moving goal posts of the American side.”
Haqqani claimed the Taliban are just looking for a round of free and fair elections, laughably pretending the murderous Islamist extremists would cheerfully accept losing and head back to their caves in peace if the Afghan people reject them:
We are aware of the concerns and questions in and outside Afghanistan about the kind of government we would have after the foreign troops withdraw. My response to such concerns is that it will depend on a consensus among Afghans. We should not let our worries get in the way of a process of genuine discussion and deliberation free for the first time from foreign domination and interference. It is important that no one front-loads this process with predetermined outcomes and preconditions. We are committed to working with other parties in a consultative manner of genuine respect to agree on a new, inclusive political system in which the voice of every Afghan is reflected and where no Afghan feels excluded. I am confident that, liberated from foreign domination and interference, we together will find a way to build an Islamic system in which all Afghans have equal rights, where the rights of women that are granted by Islam — from the right to education to the right to work — are protected, and where merit is the basis for equal opportunity.
This would be the same Taliban that gleefully murders young women for the crime of going to school and regards democracy as a crime against Islam punishable by death.
Haqqani claimed concerns about the Taliban allowing Afghanistan to be used as a staging ground for international terrorist organizations are “politically motivated exaggerations by the warmongering players on all sides of the war” and pledged to “take all measures in partnership with other Afghans to make sure the new Afghanistan is a bastion of stability and that nobody feels threatened on our soil.”
“We are ready to work on the basis of mutual respect with our international partners on long-term peace-building and reconstruction. After the United States withdraws its troops, it can play a constructive role in the postwar development and reconstruction of Afghanistan,” he wrote.
The bottom line, laid out at the end of Haqqani’s op-ed, is that the United States is clearly interested in ending its nearly two-decade involvement in Afghanistan’s endless bloodshed, and the Taliban wants the U.S. to depart badly enough to make a few immediate practical concessions plus a few long-term rhetorical concessions that everyone will pretend to believe until American troops are gone:
We are about to sign an agreement with the United States and we are fully committed to carrying out its every single provision, in letter and spirit. Achieving the potential of the agreement, ensuring its success and earning lasting peace will depend on an equally scrupulous observance by the United States of each of its commitments. Only then can we have complete trust and lay the foundation for cooperation — or even a partnership — in the future. My fellow Afghans will soon celebrate this historic agreement. Once it is entirely fulfilled, Afghans will see the departure of all foreign troops. As we arrive at this milestone, I believe it is not a distant dream that we will soon see the day when we will come together with all our Afghan brothers and sisters, start moving toward lasting peace and lay the foundation of a new Afghanistan. We would then celebrate a new beginning that invites all our compatriots to return from their exile to our country — to our shared home where everybody would have the right to live with dignity, in peace.
The tragedy of America’s 18 years in Afghanistan has been a stubborn refusal to admit the Afghan government is incapable of standing on its own, no matter how much money is poured into it, how much training its troops are given, or how many of its battles American soldiers fight. There is not much left to do except hope the Afghans rise to the occasion and hold the Taliban to some of the promises it is making.
The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) argued in August that Sirajuddin Haqqani’s position in both terrorist groups made him the man the Trump administration needed to talk to, in order to hammer out a workable exit plan from Afghanistan.
Among other factors, CFR noted the Haqqani Network is a more potent international terror threat than the Taliban and more interested in “international jihad,” while the Taliban is more focused on regaining control of Afghanistan. Haqqani’s patronage is also vital to the survival of jihadi groups in Pakistan and expanding jihad franchises beyond the Middle East.
CFR quoted the assessment of Gen. John R. Allen, former commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan, saying, “Although many Jihadi groups are sending their rank and file to places like Syria, few of these groups have the close relations with al Qaeda, media savvy, military capability, and technical expertise for suicide attacks like the Haqqani network.” For example, not many other jihad groups are media-savvy enough to get op-eds published in the New York Times without any mention of the outstanding FBI warrants for their arrest.","['gleefully', 'murders', 'democracy', 'crime']"

Exclaiming, “this is not over yet,” Biden took to Twitter on Saturday after a federal judge threw out the USWNT’s lawsuit claiming they have been paid unequally.
“To @USWNT: don’t give up this fight. This is not over yet,” Biden tweeted. “To @USSoccer: equal pay, now. Or else when I’m president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding.”

On Friday, U.S. District Court for the Central District of California Judge R. Gary Klausner excluded the women’s unequal pay charge but allowed several other charges of discrimination — including claims over the use of charter flights — to go forward to trial.
Biden’s pandering to the U.S. women’s soccer team comes amid an avalanche of charges that he sexually harassed as many as eight women from the 1990s up until the time he was serving as Barack Obama’s vice president.
Even as Biden seems to be urging America’s female soccer players to keep fighting for their rights, he has refused to allow researchers, reporters, and prosecutors, to discover whether or not he had been the subject of harassment complaints by reviewing records from his days as a U.S. Senator.

1076,The United Nations Humanitarian Affairs office warned on Monday that nearly a million Syrian civilians from northwest Idlib province had been displaced in a Russia-backed offensive there by dictator Bashar al-Assad that began in December.,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/m-blC792hwU/,breitbart,international-politics-and-world-news,right,54,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"The United Nations Humanitarian Affairs office warned on Monday that nearly a million Syrian civilians from northwest Idlib province had been displaced in a Russia-backed offensive there by dictator Bashar al-Assad that began in December.
Idlib is the last stronghold of the anti-Assad rebel movement in the country. Assad has been at war with the rebels since 2011 and has been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons against civilians and other human rights atrocities to cement his control over regions that oppose his rule. Conversely, rebel groups have faced allegations that they have cooperated with Sunni jihadist organizations, as the anti-Assad movement largely consists of Arab Sunnis opposed to the Shiite Alawite rule in Damascus.
While the struggle between Assad and Sunni rebels lies at the heart of the Syrian Civil War, as many as ten different factions have participated in violence in the country during the war, often unrelated to Assad such as the failed establishment of the Islamic State caliphate in Raqqa or clashes between the northern Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG/YPJ) and the Turkish military. Turkey claims to oppose Assad’s rule but has instead focused its energy on fighting the Kurds, who have not had any significant interaction with Assad’s army and instead largely contributed to the demise of ISIS.
The vacuum left by the fall of ISIS in the country has allowed Assad, along with allies Iran and Russia, to focus on attacking Idlib.
“The violence in north-west Syria is indiscriminate,” Mark Lowcock, U.N. Humanitarian Affairs chief, said on Monday. “We are now receiving reports that settlements for displaced people are being hit, resulting in deaths, injuries and further displacement.”
Refugees from the region “are traumatized and forced to sleep outside in freezing temperatures because camps are full,” he noted. “Mothers are burning plastic to keep children warm … babies and small children are dying because of the cold.”
Lowcock added that schools, hospitals, and other critical infrastructure has been destroyed. Exposure to nature while fleeing also leaves open the potential of a significant public health crisis in the event of disease spreading, he added.
He estimated that 900,000 people had been displaced since December 1. A week ago, the number of displaced in the region stood at 690,000 since December 1, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which estimated it was the largest number of displaced people in a single period of the Syrian Civil War. The sum is particularly jarring given that the U.N. estimates the Idlib region is home to 3 million people.
Lowcock urged U.N. Security Council action and a ceasefire to protect civilians.
Anadolu Agency, the state news agency of anti-Assad Turkey, claimed this week that the number was much higher – nearly 2 million displaced from Idlib since January. Anadolu claimed that rebels and Assad troops had declared a ceasefire recently that Assad had not respected; President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has threatened more military action against Assad in the near future.
As of this week, the United Nations estimates that over 5.6 million people have left Syria since the war began in 2011. Another 6.6 million are internally displaced, meaning they have lost their homes to the war and are either living homeless in cities or living in overcrowded refugee camps. The vast majority of those, over 3 million, who have left the country have fled to Turkey. Others in the new wave of displaced have fled to Manbij, Syrian Kurdistan. Local forces affiliated with the Kurdish fighters there have reported numbers too large to count of incoming refugees this month.
The Russian government has previously responded to United Nations reports on its atrocities in Syria by dismissing their information as false.
“They say the particular date a school or a hospital was destroyed in a particular region. They give coordinates. Our people start to double-check this and they find that there is no hospital with such coordinates, there is no school with such coordinates and the day which is mentioned by the U.N. humanitarian agencies, on this day, the Russian air force did not act at all,” Russian United Nations representative Gennady Gatilov complained in August, in response to yet another U.N. report accusing Moscow of helping Assad attack civilians. Gatilov claimed that biased NGOs on the ground provided the U.N. with misinformation.
This week, Russia has focused instead of accusing the United States of human rights violations.
“The oil fields … are controlled by the U.S. There’s shameless, impudent pillage of the wealth that belongs to Syria and the Syrian people taking place,” Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu claimed in Rome this week, referring to territories liberated from the Islamic State and managed by Syrian Kurdish groups.
The Assad regime’s state propaganda outlet, the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), claimed that, rather than terrorizing civilians, Assad has instead created a “humanitarian corridor” in Idlib for those who wish to leave.
“SANA reporter said that tens of citizens, most of them women, children, and elderly persons, exited through the humanitarian corridor established by the Syrian Arab Army west the liberated city of Ma’arat al-Nu’man, coming from the areas where the terrorists are positioned,” the outlet reported. SANA uses the term “liberated” to refer to cities under Assad control.
SANA also claimed Assad was providing medicine and food.

1118," Democracy probably cannot survive, after all, if one of our two major political parties is indifferent to its fate.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/07/how-far-will-republicans-go-to-destroy-democracy/#.XSY6699P5zg.twitter,alternet,gun-control,left,56,1,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Even before the latest Supreme Court decisions approving hyper-partisan gerrymandering and effectively allowing the addition of a citizenship question to the census, experts have wondered aloud whether Republicans remain committed to democracy. Toward the end of a recent plenary panel on Supreme Court reform at the American Constitution Society’s national convention, University of Chicago law professor Aziz Huq suggested, “We don’t really know how committed the Republican Party is to the project of democracy.”
If the GOP still values the rule of law, then perhaps the danger to democracy will recede after President Trump leaves office. But if the GOP no longer cares about democracy, then our political system could be in peril. Democracy probably cannot survive, after all, if one of our two major political parties is indifferent to its fate.
Unfortunately, the answer to Huq’s question is clear. The Republican Party is not at all committed to democracy, and GOP leaders and voters would happily tolerate alternative political arrangements. That is a worrisome claim, to be sure, but the evidence is indisputable. Republicans have abandoned any concerns they may have had for the integrity of our political system.
First, as is well understood, the GOP spent the past generation undermining the foundations of democracy — free and fair elections — so as to reinforce white rule. Thanks to the GOP’s commitment to voter suppression, paired with decades of phony rhetoric about voter fraud, millions of black and brown Americans have no access to the ballot box. Due to the Supreme Court’s evisceration of campaign finance law, unlimited and unaccountable dark money floods our politics.
Sophisticated redistricting software enables Republicans to force Democrats to waste millions of votes, leading to highly skewed electoral outcomes. These decades-long assaults required systematically coordinated tactics, such as the 50-year campaign that led to the Supreme Court’s dismantling of the Voting Rights Act. The evisceration of democracy is no accident.
Second, the GOP is structurally committed to lying. “Structurally committed” means that party leaders have little if any choice in the matter. They have to lie. And this has nothing to do with Donald Trump. One of the first things that Newt Gingrich’s Republican House majority did upon assuming power in 1995 was to undermine evidence-based policy by killing the Office of Technology Assessment and slashing the funding of the Congressional Research Service and Government Accountability Office.
Why? Republicans must disavow factual evidence because neither wing of the party (the corporate wing or the resentment wing) can tell the truth about what it stands for. The corporate wing cannot admit that it cares exclusively about tax cuts for the rich and corporate deregulation, so it has to lie about what it does. That’s why the 2002 handout to oil, gas and coal companies was called the “Clear Skies Initiative.” That’s why the 2009-2010 health care debate was framed in terms of “death panels,”as if private insurance does not ration care. That’s why the 2017 tax cut for corporations and elites was sold as a middle-class tax cut.
Nor can the resentment wing of the GOP speak honestly about the paranoid basis of its preferences. (Interestingly, Donald Trump occasionally comes close, such as when he refers to Mexicans as “rapists.”) Gun enthusiasts cannot admit that they like firearms because they fear black people. “Pro-lifers” cannot admit that they oppose abortion because they are afraid of what would happen if women controlled their bodies. (If they truly supported life, after all, they would fight climate change).
Anti-statists (of the Ruby Ridge or “Oregon standoff” variety) cannot admit that they oppose the public sector because they think government programs are for black people. Xenophobes cannot admit that they oppose immigration because they think brown people are dirty. (How often do you hear them oppose illegal immigration from Canada?) Religious extremists cannot admit that they oppose feminism and LGBTQ people because they are afraid of out-of-control sex. Neither the capitalist nor the resentment wing of the GOP can tell the truth, and that’s why the party is structurally committed to lying. As historian Timothy Snyder has explained, when a political party becomes unmoored from fact, anything is possible.
Third, the GOP has paved the way for the collapse of civilization due to climate change. While it is difficult, psychologically, to confront what’s at stake, some experts have concluded that we have already passed the point at which the collapse of humanity is inevitable, and that civilizational collapse will occur soon. The GOP, of course, has resisted mitigation of the climate crisis for decades. Even the most despicable regimes on earth, such as Syria’s, have signed onto the Paris agreement, but the GOP continues to do everything in its power to obstruct even modest reforms. The collapse of civilization will be worse than genocide, yet the GOP is happy to enable it. If a political party is willing to facilitate an outcome worse than genocide, then why would it oppose authoritarianism? The answer is that it would not.
President Trump, of course, poses an extreme threat to the rule of law. But President Trump is not the root of the problem. Nor is the GOP’s willingness to destroy “democratic norms” the root of the problem. Both Trump and GOP norm-breaking are symptoms, not causes. The root of the Republican radicalism is the triangular relationship among capital (e.g., the Koch brothers), the right-wing media (e.g., Fox News), and resentment voters (whom Hillary Clinton accurately labeled “deplorables”), the latter being the roughly 40 percent of the public who still believe Trump is doing a good job.
Long after Trump leaves the scene, Fox News will continue to manufacture paranoia to motivate resentment voters to vote for capitalists who will head to Washington to lower taxes, deregulate the economy and undermine democracy. The GOP’s capital wing cares about tax cuts and deregulation and, thanks to Fox News, has an unlimited capacity to manufacture paranoia. Its resentment wing cares about making scapegoats suffer, and has an unlimited capacity for consuming paranoia. Neither wing cares about anything else. Not fairness. Not national interest. Not democracy. Not the rule of law. From this perspective, Trump’s presidency is a gift that exposes how the machinery of the GOP works and what’s at stake in its operation.
Many progressives entertain a fantasy that the GOP can be de-radicalized at the ballot box. After all, only 40 percent of the electorate supports Trump. Crooked Media’s Jon Lovett summarized this view before last year’s midterms: “There is only one thing we can do, which is stamp out this form of Republicanism, defeat it completely and govern without them until they learn that there’s a price to be paid for the kind of politics they’ve practiced.”
Unfortunately, however, the GOP cannot be de-radicalized at the ballot box. Democrats already thrashed the GOP in wave elections in 1992, 2006, 2008 and 2018, yet after each election, the Republican Party became even more radical. After its 2012 defeat, the GOP even concluded in a self-administered autopsy that it needed to de-radicalize — and then lined up behind Trump just a few years later.
Even the most mild-mannered Republican, such as Sen. Susan Collins of Maine or former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, must govern, once in office, as a radical, no matter how sweet their smile or how gentle their manner. They are just as captured by the triangular relationship between capital, right-wing media and resentment as their more explicitly frothy colleagues. Brett Kavanaugh, after all, hails from the genteel, country club wing of the GOP, yet it took no time at all for him to unveil his radicalism, in both style and substance, at his confirmation hearing.",['survive']
1190,"Haqqani claimed the Taliban are just looking for a round of free and fair elections, laughably pretending the murderous Islamist extremists would cheerfully accept losing and head back to their caves in peace if the Afghan people reject them.",http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/EReXUAKj_UQ/,breitbart,international-politics-and-world-news,right,60,1,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The New York Times on Thursday published an op-ed written by Sirajuddin Haqqani, deputy leader of the Taliban and a globally designated terrorist with a $5 million FBI reward on his head.
Haqqani used the opportunity extended by the Times to recite Taliban propaganda and lay out the terrorist organization’s terms for peace in Afghanistan.
The FBI wants Haqqani for “questioning in connection with the January 2008 attack on a hotel in Kabul, Afghanistan, that killed six people, including an American citizen.” He is also wanted for participating in attacks on U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan and planning the attempted assassination of former Afghan President Hamid Karzai in 2008.
Haqqani is not only deputy commander of the Taliban but also the operational commander of the Haqqani Network, the infamous criminal gang and internationally designated terrorist organization allied with the Taliban that is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks and kidnappings, including U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl. Sirajuddin Haqqani’s father Jalaluddin, founder of the network, died after a long illness several years ago.
The New York Times did not see fit to provide any of this background information to readers, identifying Sirajuddin Haqqani as merely “deputy leader of the Taliban.”
In his op-ed, Haqqani portrayed the Taliban as reasonable negotiators appalled by the loss of life in Afghanistan, excusing his group’s atrocities and remorseless attacks on civilians as justified acts of self-defense. He blamed the United States for undermining previous efforts at working out a peace deal.
“We did not choose our war with the foreign coalition led by the United States. We were forced to defend ourselves. The withdrawal of foreign forces has been our first and foremost demand. That we today stand at the threshold of a peace agreement with the United States is no small milestone,” Haqqani wrote.
The terrorist leader claimed that his side stuck with the current round of negotiations despite “the intensified bombing campaign against our villages by the United States and the flip-flopping and ever-moving goal posts of the American side.”
Haqqani claimed the Taliban are just looking for a round of free and fair elections, laughably pretending the murderous Islamist extremists would cheerfully accept losing and head back to their caves in peace if the Afghan people reject them:
We are aware of the concerns and questions in and outside Afghanistan about the kind of government we would have after the foreign troops withdraw. My response to such concerns is that it will depend on a consensus among Afghans. We should not let our worries get in the way of a process of genuine discussion and deliberation free for the first time from foreign domination and interference. It is important that no one front-loads this process with predetermined outcomes and preconditions. We are committed to working with other parties in a consultative manner of genuine respect to agree on a new, inclusive political system in which the voice of every Afghan is reflected and where no Afghan feels excluded. I am confident that, liberated from foreign domination and interference, we together will find a way to build an Islamic system in which all Afghans have equal rights, where the rights of women that are granted by Islam — from the right to education to the right to work — are protected, and where merit is the basis for equal opportunity.
This would be the same Taliban that gleefully murders young women for the crime of going to school and regards democracy as a crime against Islam punishable by death.
Haqqani claimed concerns about the Taliban allowing Afghanistan to be used as a staging ground for international terrorist organizations are “politically motivated exaggerations by the warmongering players on all sides of the war” and pledged to “take all measures in partnership with other Afghans to make sure the new Afghanistan is a bastion of stability and that nobody feels threatened on our soil.”
“We are ready to work on the basis of mutual respect with our international partners on long-term peace-building and reconstruction. After the United States withdraws its troops, it can play a constructive role in the postwar development and reconstruction of Afghanistan,” he wrote.
The bottom line, laid out at the end of Haqqani’s op-ed, is that the United States is clearly interested in ending its nearly two-decade involvement in Afghanistan’s endless bloodshed, and the Taliban wants the U.S. to depart badly enough to make a few immediate practical concessions plus a few long-term rhetorical concessions that everyone will pretend to believe until American troops are gone:
We are about to sign an agreement with the United States and we are fully committed to carrying out its every single provision, in letter and spirit. Achieving the potential of the agreement, ensuring its success and earning lasting peace will depend on an equally scrupulous observance by the United States of each of its commitments. Only then can we have complete trust and lay the foundation for cooperation — or even a partnership — in the future. My fellow Afghans will soon celebrate this historic agreement. Once it is entirely fulfilled, Afghans will see the departure of all foreign troops. As we arrive at this milestone, I believe it is not a distant dream that we will soon see the day when we will come together with all our Afghan brothers and sisters, start moving toward lasting peace and lay the foundation of a new Afghanistan. We would then celebrate a new beginning that invites all our compatriots to return from their exile to our country — to our shared home where everybody would have the right to live with dignity, in peace.
The tragedy of America’s 18 years in Afghanistan has been a stubborn refusal to admit the Afghan government is incapable of standing on its own, no matter how much money is poured into it, how much training its troops are given, or how many of its battles American soldiers fight. There is not much left to do except hope the Afghans rise to the occasion and hold the Taliban to some of the promises it is making.
The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) argued in August that Sirajuddin Haqqani’s position in both terrorist groups made him the man the Trump administration needed to talk to, in order to hammer out a workable exit plan from Afghanistan.
Among other factors, CFR noted the Haqqani Network is a more potent international terror threat than the Taliban and more interested in “international jihad,” while the Taliban is more focused on regaining control of Afghanistan. Haqqani’s patronage is also vital to the survival of jihadi groups in Pakistan and expanding jihad franchises beyond the Middle East.
CFR quoted the assessment of Gen. John R. Allen, former commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan, saying, “Although many Jihadi groups are sending their rank and file to places like Syria, few of these groups have the close relations with al Qaeda, media savvy, military capability, and technical expertise for suicide attacks like the Haqqani network.” For example, not many other jihad groups are media-savvy enough to get op-eds published in the New York Times without any mention of the outstanding FBI warrants for their arrest.","['murderous', 'extremists', 'pretending', 'laughably', 'caves']"

BERLIN — Berlin is trying to stop Washington from persuading a German company seeking a coronavirus vaccine to move its research to the United States, prompting German politicians to insist no country should have a monopoly on any future vaccine.
German government sources told Reuters on Sunday that the U.S. administration was looking into how it could gain access to a potential vaccine being developed by a German firm, CureVac.
Earlier, the Welt am Sonntag German newspaper reported that President Donald Trump had offered funds to lure CureVac to the United States, and the German government was making counter-offers to tempt it to stay.
""The German government is very interested in ensuring that vaccines and active substances against the new coronavirus are also developed in Germany and Europe,"" a Health Ministry spokeswoman said, confirming a quote in the newspaper.
""In this regard, the government is in intensive exchange with the company CureVac,"" she added.
A senior American official later said the Welt report was wrong.
""Not true. The Welt story was wrong,"" said Richard Grenell, acting Director of National Intelligence and the U.S. Ambassador to Germany, referring to the newspaper report.
""Now everyone is back peddling,"" he added on Twitter.

Not true. The Welt story was wrong. But Business Insider, Reuters and others went with it anyway despite not having their own sources. Now everyone is back peddling. https://t.co/88UohluwTj — Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) March 15, 2020
A German Economy Ministry spokeswoman also said Berlin ""has a great interest"" in producing vaccines in Germany and Europe.
She declined to comment on any takeover possibilities but referred to Germany's foreign trade law, under which Berlin can examine takeover bids from non-EU, so-called third countries ""if national or European security interests are at stake.""
In a statement issued Sunday, the company said it ""rejects current rumors of an acquisition.""
The statement added that while it was in contact with ""authorities worldwide,"" it ""abstains from commenting on speculations and rejects allegations about offers for acquisition of the company or its technology.""
A spokesperson for CureVac also denied the report. ""To make it clear again on coronavirus: CureVac has not received from the U.S. government or related entities an offer before, during and since the Task Force meeting in the White House on March 2. CureVac rejects all allegations from press,"" the spokesperson said.
Florian von der Muelbe, CureVac's chief production officer and co-founder, told Reuters last week the company had started with a multitude of coronavirus vaccine candidates and was now selecting the two best to go into clinical trials.
The privately-held company based in Tuebingen, Germany, hopes to have an experimental vaccine ready by June or July to then seek the go-ahead from regulators for testing on humans.
On its website, CureVac said CEO Daniel Menichella early this month met with Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force and senior representatives of pharmaceutical and biotech companies to discuss a vaccine.
Karl Lauterbach, a professor of health economics and epidemiology who is also a senior lawmaker with Germany's Social Democrats, tweeted in reaction to the Welt am Sonntag report: ""The exclusive sale of a possible vaccine to the USA must be prevented by all means. Capitalism has limits.""
CureVac in 2015 and 2018 secured financial backing for development projects from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, working on shots to prevent malaria and influenza.
In the field of so-called mRNA therapeutics, CureVac competes with U.S. biotech firm Moderna and German rival BioNTech, which Pfizer has identified as a potential collaboration partner.
Drugs based on mRNA provide a type of genetic blueprint that can be injected into the body to instruct cells to produce the desired therapeutic proteins. That contrasts with the conventional approach of making these proteins in labs and bio-reactors.
In the case of vaccines, the mRNA prompts body cells to produce so-called antigens, the tell-tale molecules on the surface of viruses, that spur the immune system into action.
Companies working on other coronavirus-vaccine approaches include Johnson & Johnson and INOVIO Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

1370,"Donald Trump, by design, is a chaos monster who shovels crap out faster than people can process it.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/trump-is-desperate-and-encouraging-violence-from-his-superfans/,alternet,gun-control,left,69,1,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Donald Trump, by design, is a chaos monster who shovels crap out faster than people can process it. Unencumbered by normal human qualities like empathy or conscience, Trump can bounce from one awful behavior from another — grifting, sexual assault and harassment, racism, lying, conspiracy-mongering, criminal schemes — with astonishing speed, doing more wicked deeds in a day that what most aspiring villains can accomplish in a year or even a lifetime.
In an effort to get a handle on the endless deluge of awfulness pouring out of Trump, it’s become common to describe some of the godawful things he does as “distractions” from other awful things he does. It’s an effort to triage our response, apparently on the theory that figuring out which Trump evils rank higher than others can somehow sharpen our efforts to process and resist them. It’s an honorable desire based in empirical evidence: Indeed, Trump sometimes does or says nasty things to divert public and media attention from other nasty things he does or says. Unfortunately, this often fails to understand that the nasty stuff Trump does to distract us from other nasty stuff is incredibly dangerous on its own terms, and can’t just be shrugged off as a pure or content-free distraction.
Today’s case in point: Trump, who has frequently indulged in late-night binges of Twitter vitriol while most Americans are asleep, was at it again late on Wednesday night when he decided to promote a video by a cowboy cosplayer and Trump superfan named Couy Griffin declaring, “The only good Democrat is a dead Democrat.”
“Thank you Cowboys. See you in New Mexico!” Trump said of the video, which echoed a 19th-century slogan — “the only good Indian is a dead Indian” — used to justify genocide against Native Americans.
So far, however, the mainstream media reaction has been a big, fat shrug. And it’s easy to see why. Indeed, it’s fair to argue that Trump’s trolling antics of late are an attempt to distract attention from the real-world disaster unfolding in this country, largely due to his negligence. The U.S. has officially crossed mark of 100,000 dead from COVID-19. More than 40 million people who have filed for unemployment. Trump has entirely given up on even pretending to have any national strategy for fighting the virus, beyond demanding that states “reopen” ASAP to let the virus wash over us and kill untold thousands more.
“This whole thing is a distraction, and you know it,” Chris Cuomo of CNN said on Wednesday night, adding that Trump stirs the pot with this hateful nonsense to distract “from the dead and the dire situation that [he’s] basically ignoring.”
On Thursday morning, MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, who has been fending off Trump’s vile and baseless murder accusations in recent weeks, made a similar point. Trump defames him and others, Scarborough said, to distract us from the fact that he ignored or neglected the coronavirus pandemic for months. He would rather have people “talk about how vile his tweets are or how dangerous his fight with Twitter is” than about the 100,000 dead.
Neither Cuomo nor Scarborough was talking specifically about Trump tweeting out violent rhetoric toward Democrats — Cuomo’s segment aired shortly bit before Trump did that — but about the mountainous garbage fire of the president’s Twitter feed in general, of which this threatening rhetoric was just a small piece. Trump is absolutely throwing out whatever he can in a desperate bid to regain control of the conversation so that his massive failures aren’t the focus. That’s led to at least two nights where he stayed up late and sent more than 100 tweets, in hopes of coughing up something outrageous enough to seize the headlines.
So it’s true that these things are blatant distractions. But it doesn’t follow that the best approach is necessarily to ignore Trump’s childish behavior. The fact the president of the United States is encouraging domestic terrorism against “Democrats” — not just against specific politicians, which would be bad enough, but against anyone who identifies as a Democrat — is not a small thing. On the contrary, it’s incredibly dangerous.
It wasn’t all that long ago, though it may seem like another epoch, when a domestic terrorist apparently set out to murder Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and the staffers at CNN — among others — with mail bombs, because he loved Trump so much. In fact, the president’s level of plausible deniability was higher then: That was before Trump had openly called for such violence. Now there’s an army of angry reactionaries with guns — whom Trump has eagerly encouraged with his “LIBERATE” tweets — who hang on his every word and appear ready to escalate to open armed insurrection. It’s undeniable that at least a few people, and perhaps more than that, will interpret this as a push to lash out with targeted violence in the middle of an election year. The only real question is how widespread that violence will be.
Let’s not fool ourselves here. In the video Trump tweeted, Griffin pivots from his incendiary language to claim that he only wishes Democrats dead “in a political sense.” This falls somewhere between legalistic ass-covering and standard-issue gaslighting, with Griffin trying to hoodwink people into ignoring what he said just moments before. He’s trying to have his right-wing shitposting cake and eat it too, openly encouraging violence while also trying to evade responsibility with digressive, rambling explanations of how you can’t believe he really means what he just said.
But Griffin means it, and Trump does too. As Will Sommer of The Daily Beast found when he interviewed Griffin, the guy does a piss-poor job at disguising his obvious longing for violent retribution against Democrats, who he believes have no legitimate claim to representation in politics.
“You get to pick your poison: you either go before a firing squad, or you get the end of the rope,” Griffin said of Democratic governors, right after claiming he wasn’t seriously proposing killing anyone. When asked whether anti-lockdown protesters were considering violence, Griffin said, “There’s not an option that’s not on the table.”
Like Donald Trump, Griffin’s an obvious coward who wants to push violent rhetoric but isn’t willing to face the consequences for doing so. By pushing Griffin’s speech, Trump is engaging in stochastic terrorism, in which a prominent voice puts out the suggestion of radical violence, but refuses to acknowledge any responsibility if and when someone else acts on it.
Trump is desperate and clinging to anything he can use, including threats of violence, to scare Democratic voters away from the polls in November. Since the presidential election is our last available mechanism to remove Trump and replace him with someone vaguely sane and competent, this is no small thing. In the age of the coronavirus, in fact, replacing Trump with someone competent is more important than ever. It’s quite literally the only hope this country has of saving lives and saving our economy.
There’s a way to call out Trump’s violent trolling while also keeping the focus on the rising numbers of dead and unemployed. It’s about going meta — pointing out not just the facts of Trump’s behavior, but why he’s doing the things he does.
That’s actually what Cuomo and Scarborough did in their TV segments, ironically enough. Neither man is actually ignoring Trump’s Twitter antics. They highlight that stuff while also explaining to viewers the not-so-hidden purpose of such trolling: Trying to divert attention away from the 100,000 dead and 40 million unemployed. Their segments are good examples of how to walk and chew gum at the same time. They’re not taking the “ignore his antics and he’ll go away” approach. Rather, they’re doing what all journalists should be doing, which is closer to a both/and approach — calling out Trump’s often violent and mendacious distractions while also highlighting the real toll of his leadership failures on the American people.
That’s what everyone in media should be doing. Ignoring Trump won’t make him go away. He is still president, unfortunately. He will always have a direct line to his followers, and now he’s using that connection to deliver unsubtle hints that they should use violence to prevent Democrats from voting him out of office. He’s also playing the same game with his false accusations against Scarborough, creating a permission structure for some lunatic with a gun who wants to avenge his orange godhead against the “fake news.”
Sadly, men with guns who want to hurt you isn’t a problem we can just ignore away.
We can focus instead not just on what Trump is doing but why he’s doing it. What: Using incendiary rhetoric in hopes of inspire his followers to take violent action on his behalf. Why: Because he’s becoming aware that, thanks to his massive failures as president, he probably can’t keep power through nonviolent and legal means. Donald Trump’s increasingly dangerous flirtation with using mob violence to subvert democracy isn’t a small story. It must be covered, but covered carefully — and always by pointing toward the dark goals he hopes to accomplish with this vile behavior.","['chaos', 'monster', 'shovels', 'crap']"
1626,Assad has been at war with the rebels since 2011 and has been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons against civilians and other human rights atrocities to cement his control over regions that oppose his rule.,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/m-blC792hwU/,breitbart,international-politics-and-world-news,right,82,1,Biased,Entirely factual,"The United Nations Humanitarian Affairs office warned on Monday that nearly a million Syrian civilians from northwest Idlib province had been displaced in a Russia-backed offensive there by dictator Bashar al-Assad that began in December.
Idlib is the last stronghold of the anti-Assad rebel movement in the country. Assad has been at war with the rebels since 2011 and has been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons against civilians and other human rights atrocities to cement his control over regions that oppose his rule. Conversely, rebel groups have faced allegations that they have cooperated with Sunni jihadist organizations, as the anti-Assad movement largely consists of Arab Sunnis opposed to the Shiite Alawite rule in Damascus.
While the struggle between Assad and Sunni rebels lies at the heart of the Syrian Civil War, as many as ten different factions have participated in violence in the country during the war, often unrelated to Assad such as the failed establishment of the Islamic State caliphate in Raqqa or clashes between the northern Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG/YPJ) and the Turkish military. Turkey claims to oppose Assad’s rule but has instead focused its energy on fighting the Kurds, who have not had any significant interaction with Assad’s army and instead largely contributed to the demise of ISIS.
The vacuum left by the fall of ISIS in the country has allowed Assad, along with allies Iran and Russia, to focus on attacking Idlib.
“The violence in north-west Syria is indiscriminate,” Mark Lowcock, U.N. Humanitarian Affairs chief, said on Monday. “We are now receiving reports that settlements for displaced people are being hit, resulting in deaths, injuries and further displacement.”
Refugees from the region “are traumatized and forced to sleep outside in freezing temperatures because camps are full,” he noted. “Mothers are burning plastic to keep children warm … babies and small children are dying because of the cold.”
Lowcock added that schools, hospitals, and other critical infrastructure has been destroyed. Exposure to nature while fleeing also leaves open the potential of a significant public health crisis in the event of disease spreading, he added.
He estimated that 900,000 people had been displaced since December 1. A week ago, the number of displaced in the region stood at 690,000 since December 1, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which estimated it was the largest number of displaced people in a single period of the Syrian Civil War. The sum is particularly jarring given that the U.N. estimates the Idlib region is home to 3 million people.
Lowcock urged U.N. Security Council action and a ceasefire to protect civilians.
Anadolu Agency, the state news agency of anti-Assad Turkey, claimed this week that the number was much higher – nearly 2 million displaced from Idlib since January. Anadolu claimed that rebels and Assad troops had declared a ceasefire recently that Assad had not respected; President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has threatened more military action against Assad in the near future.
As of this week, the United Nations estimates that over 5.6 million people have left Syria since the war began in 2011. Another 6.6 million are internally displaced, meaning they have lost their homes to the war and are either living homeless in cities or living in overcrowded refugee camps. The vast majority of those, over 3 million, who have left the country have fled to Turkey. Others in the new wave of displaced have fled to Manbij, Syrian Kurdistan. Local forces affiliated with the Kurdish fighters there have reported numbers too large to count of incoming refugees this month.
The Russian government has previously responded to United Nations reports on its atrocities in Syria by dismissing their information as false.
“They say the particular date a school or a hospital was destroyed in a particular region. They give coordinates. Our people start to double-check this and they find that there is no hospital with such coordinates, there is no school with such coordinates and the day which is mentioned by the U.N. humanitarian agencies, on this day, the Russian air force did not act at all,” Russian United Nations representative Gennady Gatilov complained in August, in response to yet another U.N. report accusing Moscow of helping Assad attack civilians. Gatilov claimed that biased NGOs on the ground provided the U.N. with misinformation.
This week, Russia has focused instead of accusing the United States of human rights violations.
“The oil fields … are controlled by the U.S. There’s shameless, impudent pillage of the wealth that belongs to Syria and the Syrian people taking place,” Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu claimed in Rome this week, referring to territories liberated from the Islamic State and managed by Syrian Kurdish groups.
The Assad regime’s state propaganda outlet, the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), claimed that, rather than terrorizing civilians, Assad has instead created a “humanitarian corridor” in Idlib for those who wish to leave.
“SANA reporter said that tens of citizens, most of them women, children, and elderly persons, exited through the humanitarian corridor established by the Syrian Arab Army west the liberated city of Ma’arat al-Nu’man, coming from the areas where the terrorists are positioned,” the outlet reported. SANA uses the term “liberated” to refer to cities under Assad control.
SANA also claimed Assad was providing medicine and food.

During the months-long Republican effort to tear down the Affordable Care Act, at no point did Donald Trump ever sit down for talks with congressional Democrats. This was neither an accident nor an oversight. As regular readers may recall , it was an open secret that Republicans were terrified of the prospect of the president negotiating directly with Democratic leaders.
The fear, of course, was that the amateur president would sit down Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, he’d find their pitch compelling, and Trump would end up giving Dems everything they asked for.
Similarly, about a year ago, White House officials balked at allowing Trump to hold private negotiations with proponents of a bipartisan immigration reform measure. Again, people close to the president, realizing that he didn’t know anything about the subject matter, and acknowledging the reality that the president was more interested in striking a deal than what the deal entailed, took great pains to prohibit one-on-one talks.
The likelihood of Trump being “tricked” into endorsing a good proposal was simply too high.
As the Republican president gets ready for another meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, those fears have risen anew. Politico reported the other day that White House officials believe it’s possible Trump will be “outfoxed” into giving away too much in Hanoi.
[Several] of the president’s top advisers] have expressed trepidation not only that the summit … may not yield big results. They worry, too, that Trump, eager to declare victory on the world stage, could make big concessions in exchange for empty promises of denuclearization. The push for a second summit came almost entirely from the president himself, according to current and former White House officials — but Trump remains undeterred. He has gushed about the “wonderful letters” he has received from Kim, as well as the “good rapport” he has developed with the North Korean leader and the enormous media coverage the event in Vietnam’s capital is likely to attract. Trump even bragged, in a phone call Tuesday with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, that he is the only person who can make progress on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, according to a person briefed on the conversation, and complained about negative news coverage he has received.
There’s an implicit understanding that often goes unstated: everyone seems to quietly realize that Trump doesn’t know what he’s doing. Worse, he doesn’t seem to care about his ignorance or incompetence – events like these are about “spectacle” – so the American leader makes no real effort to prepare for meetings such as these.
The Republican president entered the initial round of talks with the North Korean dictator in Singapore with minimal preparation – Trump went so far as to mock the very idea of doing pre-summit homework – and soon after, he made a series of concessions to Kim Jong-un in exchange for effectively nothing.
Will this round be any different? During a call with reporters last week, a senior administration official insisted, “The president is doing everything necessary to be well prepared for this summit.” Five minutes later, Trump began tweeting about an actor accused of orchestrating an attack against him for publicity. Soon after, he tweeted his support for a GOP senator’s re-election bid – 19 months before voters go to the polls.
The lack of focus didn’t inspire confidence.
What’s more, there’s little doubt that Pyongyang already sees the American leader as a man whose incompetence can be exploited. Bloomberg had a good report on these lines late last week:
“They do look to get President Trump in a room and see what they might get out of him,” said Christopher Hill, the North Korea negotiator under President George W. Bush. “If Singapore is any indication, the president seeks to want to negotiate everything himself.” Kim and his team seem to be betting on a repeat. A senior Trump administration official, who asked not to be identified discussing internal deliberations, said North Korean officials have so far given little away in their meetings with the top U.S. envoy for the talks, Stephen Biegun. The official said the fear is that Kim will make an offer to Trump that sounds good at the moment, inspiring the president to sacrifice something in return that goes too far.
No modern White House had to worry about such things, largely because U.S. officials trusted their boss to be responsible and sensible during delicate negotiations.
In this administration, there’s a broad understanding that Donald Trump is … how do I put this delicately … different, and that creates an unsettling amount of uncertainty about what the president, desperate for progress, might give away to the dictator he claims to have fallen in love with.","['concessions', 'mock', 'minimal', 'preparation']"
