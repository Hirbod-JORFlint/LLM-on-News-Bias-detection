5,The World Anti-Doping Agency on Tuesday said that Russian authorities had failed to provide access to laboratory doping data by their year-end deadline and it will consider sanctions against the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-doping-wada-russia/doping-wada-bitterly-disappointed-at-russias-failure-to-meet-deadline-idUSKCN1OV1Q5,reuters,sport,center,1,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"(Reuters) - The World Anti-Doping Agency on Tuesday said that Russian authorities had failed to provide access to laboratory doping data by their year-end deadline and it will consider sanctions against the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).

RUSADA was stripped of its accreditation in 2015 after a WADA-commissioned report found evidence of widespread state-sponsored doping in Russian athletics. But it was conditionally - and controversially - reinstated in September.
“I am bitterly disappointed that data extraction from the former Moscow Laboratory has not been completed by the date agreed by WADA’s (executive committee) in September 2018,” said WADA President Craig Reedie.
“Since then, WADA has been working diligently with the Russian authorities to meet the deadline, which was clearly in the best interest of clean sport. The process agreed by WADA’s ExCo in September will now be initiated.”
WADA’s Compliance Review Committee (CRC) will meet Jan. 14-15 to review the situation and make a recommendation to WADA’s executive committee on how to proceed.
If the CRC recommends declaring RUSADA non-compliant and the executive committee agrees, the Russian agency will have the right to challenge in the Court of Arbitration for Sport, who will hear the case and make the final decision.
Reedie said WADA had written to Pavel Kolobkov, Russia’s minister of sport, and Yury Ganus, the director general of RUSADA, to notify them of the situation and to remind them of the next steps in the process.
Kolobkov on Saturday said Moscow and WADA were discussing a date for WADA experts to visit and receive laboratory data in the hopes of avoiding another suspension.
Last month WADA said an inspection team visiting the Moscow laboratory was denied access to raw data after Russian authorities said that the inspection team’s equipment was not certified under Russian law.
IOC President Thomas Bach on Tuesday suggested the IOC was ready to move on following Russia’s ban from the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in February.
“In Pyeongchang, we sanctioned the systematic manipulation of the anti-doping system in Russia during the Olympic Winter Games Sochi 2014,” he said in a New Year’s message.
“With its suspension from the Olympic Winter Games Pyeongchang 2018, the Russian Olympic Committee has served its sanction.”
CRITICS RALLY
But critics of Russia urged WADA to take a hard line against the nation for missing the deadline.
“The situation is a total joke and an embarrassment for WADA and the global anti-doping system,” Travis Tygart, the CEO of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, said on Tuesday.
“In September, WADA secretly moved the goal posts and reinstated Russia against the wishes of athletes, governments and the public.
“In doing this, WADA guaranteed Russia would turn over the evidence of its state-supported doping scheme by today.
“No-one is surprised this deadline was ignored, and it’s time for WADA to stop being played by the Russians and immediately declare them non-compliant for failing yet again to meet the deadline.”
The United Kingdom Anti-Doping Agency athlete commission and Drug Free Sport New Zealand were among the groups that called on WADA to find RUSADA non-compliant for missing the deadline.
“Time for negotiation and compromise with Russia is now past,” said Nick Paterson, chief executive for Drug Free Sport NZ. “Clean sport and clean athletes deserve our support.
“It is time to stand strong, and all those involved in the fight against doping to stand together.”",[]

REUTERS/Axel Schmidt
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The German Federal State of Baden-Wuerttemberg is seeking damages from Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) after local authorities purchased VW diesel vehicles which now face bans in cities like Stuttgart, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said on Saturday.
The value of diesel cars plummeted after German environmental groups scored a court victory last year that forced cities to consider bans of older diesel vehicles to bring emissions into line with European Union clean air rules.
The FAZ daily said state authorities filed a lawsuit with a court in Stuttgart at the end of last year, seeking damages totaling “low double digit millions”.
Volkswagen could not confirm this, and told Reuters the company had not seen the particular lawsuit.
But it added that previous court decisions had backed its stance that legal actions to seek damages are without merit given that VW cars had valid road certification at the time of sale.
Officials at Baden-Wuerttemberg state could not be immediately reached for comment.
The paper said taxpayer money had been spent on buying and leasing diesel vehicles for the police service. It did not specify how Baden-Wuerttemberg had lost money.
U.S. regulators in 2015 blew the whistle on Volkswagen’s systematic emissions test cheating which revealed that the carmaker’s vehicles emitted far higher levels of nitrogen oxide pollution than permitted by the law.
A global clampdown on pollution ensued, prompting regulators and environmental groups in Germany to scrutinize emissions. Unlike in the United States, older VW cars have not been found to be illegal in Germany after the carmaker agreed recall its vehicles to modify emissions filtering systems.",[]
27,"Mississippi’s Republican governor signed one of America’s strictest abortion bills on Thursday banning women from obtaining an abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can often occur before a woman even realizes she is pregnant.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mississippi-abortion/mississippi-governor-to-sign-heartbeat-abortion-ban-idUSKCN1R21HA,reuters,abortion,center,2,1,No agreement,Entirely factual,"(Reuters) - Mississippi’s Republican governor signed one of America’s strictest abortion bills on Thursday banning women from obtaining an abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can often occur before a woman even realizes she is pregnant.
FILE PHOTO: Phil Bryant, governor of Mississippi, speaks during an election night party for Republican U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith in Jackson, Mississippi, U.S., November 27, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman
Dubbed the ‘heartbeat bill,’ this is the second legislative attempt in less than a year aimed at restricting abortions in a state with a single abortion clinic.
In a tweet earlier this week, Governor Phil Bryant thanked the state’s legislature for “protecting the unborn” by passing the bill and sending it to him for his signature.
The Mississippi law joins a wave of similar Republican-backed measures recently introduced in Iowa, Kentucky, Tennessee and Georgia.
Conservative Republican proponents say these bills are intended to challenge Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 landmark ruling that women have a constitutional right to an abortion.
U.S. states are jostling for a showdown on abortion rights in 2019, with all eyes on the conservative-dominated Supreme Court.
Just last November, a U.S. federal judge struck down a Mississippi law banning most abortions after 15 weeks, ruling that it “unequivocally” violates women’s constitutional rights.
The new Mississippi bill prohibits the abortion of a fetus with a detectable heartbeat, before the point where a woman may be aware she are pregnant.
It also states that any physician who violates the restriction is subject to losing the license to practice medicine.
The law makes exceptions for women whose health is at extreme risk. It is a victory for anti-abortion groups, but abortion rights advocates have promised to pursue legal action to overturn it.
“This ban is one of the most restrictive abortion bans signed into law, and we will take Mississippi to court to make sure it never takes effect,” Hillary Schneller, staff attorney at the global abortion rights advocacy group Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement.
“This ban — just like the 15 week ban the Governor signed a year ago — is cruel and clearly unconstitutional.”
A fetus that is viable outside the womb, usually at 24 weeks, has widely been considered the threshold in the United States to prohibit an abortion.
Last week, a federal judge blocked Kentucky’s fetal heartbeat abortion law. An Iowa judge overturned that state’s heartbeat law in January after declaring it violated the state’s constitution.","['strictest', 'abortion']"
30,"Biden was particularly critical of Trump’s visit on Monday to a historic church across from the White House, which was preceded by law enforcement authorities dispersing a crowd near the church with smoke canisters and flash grenades.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden/biden-vows-to-heal-racial-wounds-rips-trump-as-divisive-is-this-who-we-want-to-be-idUSKBN2391ZB,reuters,elections-2020,center,2,1,Biased,Entirely factual,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Tuesday blasted President Donald Trump’s response to U.S. protests over racism and police misconduct, vowing to try to heal the country’s racial divide and not “fan the flames of hate.”
Speaking in Philadelphia – a city rocked by sometimes violent demonstrations in recent days – the former vice president sought to draw a vivid contrast between himself and Trump, whom he will face in the Nov. 3 general election.
Biden, who served eight years as vice president under Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, cast himself as the candidate who best understands the longstanding pain and grief in the country’s black communities.
He said the killing of George Floyd, the African-American man who died at the hands of Minneapolis police last week, was a “wake-up call” for the nation that must force it to address the stain of systemic racism.
“We can’t leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away and do nothing,” Biden said. “We can’t.”
He accused Trump, a Republican, of turning the nation into “a battlefield riven by old resentments and fresh fears.”
“Is this who we want to be?” he asked. “Is this what we want to pass on to our children and grandchildren? Fear, anger, finger pointing, rather than the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety, self-absorption, selfishness?”
Biden was particularly critical of Trump’s visit on Monday to a historic church across from the White House, which was preceded by law enforcement authorities dispersing a crowd near the church with smoke canisters and flash grenades.
“We can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,” said Biden, who accused Trump of “serving the passions” of his conservative base at the expense of the rest of the country.

Biden pledged he would “not traffic in fear or division.”
Biden, 77, has been under pressure from young African-Americans and other progressives to aggressively address racial and economic inequities in the country - and he has been increasingly talking in terms of sweeping societal change.
His long history in the Senate, where he authored a now-heavily criticized crime bill in the 1990s, has at times complicated that effort, sowing some mistrust among activists.
At the same time, he has been mindful of condemning the looting and violence that has marked some of the protests.
Trump campaign senior adviser Katrina Pierson accused Biden in a statement after the speech of making “the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.”
Trump on Monday called the violence at the protests “acts of domestic terror” and threatened to deploy the U.S. military to secure the nation’s cities.
Biden’s speech on Tuesday at Philadelphia’s City Hall marked the first time he has left his home state of Delaware since mid-March, when the outbreak of the novel coronavirus forced him to halt in-person campaigning.
While Biden had made public appearances in Delaware in recent days and convened a virtual conference of big-city mayors on Monday, Tuesday’s speech suggested he may soon begin to again move about the country as states slowly re-open.
Biden formally launched his White House bid in Philadelphia last year, and it’s where his campaign headquarters - currently empty because of the pandemic - is located.

The city was also the birthplace of the U.S. Constitution, which Biden cited in his speech as support of the right to peacefully protest.

Hundreds of wildfires have scorched more than 5.25 million hectares (13 million acres) of bushland and destroyed over 1,000 homes over the last few months.
Kyrgios, the country’s best known current tennis player, called on Thursday for the organization of a fundraising exhibition event ahead of the Australia Open, the year’s first Grand Slam which kicks off in Melbourne on Jan. 20.
Australian cricketers Glenn Maxwell and Chris Lynn pledged A$250 for every six they hit during the Big Bash League Twenty20 tournament.
There have also been pledges of help from A-League soccer clubs in the state of Victoria and American basketballer LaMelo Ball - a top-five NBA draft prospect - who has offered to donate one month’s salary from the Illawarra Hawks.
Tennis Australia said on Friday it would hold a “Rally for Relief” exhibition match at the Rod Laver Arena on Jan. 15 to help raise funds, while proceeds from a Jessica Mauboy concert on the eve of the Open will also be donated to the Red Cross appeal.
Kyrgios said he would be at the exhibition and while no other names have been confirmed, most of the best tennis players in the world are already in Australia for the inaugural edition of the ATP Cup and other warm-up tournaments.
Kyrgios has also put his hand up individually by promising a A$200 ($140) donation for every ace he serves during Australia’s summer of tennis and has been joined by a number of fellow players in the drive, including former U.S. Open champion Samantha Stosur.
Hazardous smoke from the fires forced the abandonment of a Big Bash match in the nation’s capital on Dec. 21 and organizers, anticipating similar disruption, decided on Friday to move the Canberra International tennis tournament.
The ATP Challenger/ITF Futures tournament, scheduled to take place in Canberra next week, has been moved to the city of Bendigo.
Sporting events went ahead under sunny skies in Sydney on Friday with no sign of the thick layer of smoke that has shrouded the city on several occasions over the last few months.
The third cricket test between Australia and New Zealand at the Sydney Cricket Ground got underway in front of a big crowd under sunny skies after a minute of applause for the emergency services fighting the fires.
Organizers have prepared for smoke delays during the match with all eyes on Saturday when temperatures are set to soar above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).",['rallied']
35,"Under current immigration policies, it’s possible that immigration arrests could lead to poor mental health by increasing deportation fears among undocumented individuals and their families and neighbors, the study authors write.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-mental-immigration-policy/immigration-raids-tied-to-worse-mental-health-among-hispanic-americans-idUSKBN1XV2L2,reuters,immigration,center,2,1,Biased,No agreement,"(Reuters Health) - Hispanic Americans may experience worsening mental health when immigration arrests spike, a U.S. study suggests.
Researchers examined data on people who identified as Hispanic or Latino in nationally-representative behavioral health surveys administered from 2014 to 2018. Overall, more than one third of these participants reported at least one day of poor mental health in the previous month, and about 11% reported frequent mental distress.
During the study period, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) made 440,601 arrests, the study team notes in the American Journal of Public Health. Arrests increased sharply after a series of anti-immigration executive orders in 2017 that authorized a border wall with Mexico, banned U.S. entry for people from several predominantly Muslim countries, and modified ICE policies around arrests and deportation.
Changes in arrest rates varied by state. But each 1-percentage point increase in a state’s immigration arrest rate following these immigration policy changes was associated with significantly worse mental health outcomes for Hispanic people in the study.
“Given that immigration policy continues to be a deeply contested topic, ensuring that the health and social consequences of aggressive enforcement are identified and acknowledged within national debates is a key priority,” study authors Emilie Bruzelius of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University in New York City and Aaron Baum of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City write.
ICE has arrested more than 2 million immigrants living without authorization in the U.S. since 2008, the researchers note. Some previous research suggests that immigration-related anxiety could have a detrimental impact on mental health, particularly among racial/ethnic groups that have been disproportionately targeted for arrest and deportation.
Under current immigration policies, it’s possible that immigration arrests could lead to poor mental health by increasing deportation fears among undocumented individuals and their families and neighbors, the study authors write. People from populations targeted by these immigration policies might also experience more discrimination, which worsens mental health.
Across the entire study period, participants reported an average of 3.62 days of poor mental health during the previous month.
When researchers looked only at the 2017 shift in immigration policies, they didn’t find these policies to be associated with changes in mental health.
But when they looked at both the 2017 policy shifts and changes in arrest rates, they found states that had bigger spikes in arrest rates also had larger increases in the number of poor mental health days. These states also had bigger increases in the proportion of people reporting any days of poor mental health or frequent mental distress.
Compared to the period before the immigration policy shifts, a 1-percentage point increase in arrest rates after a policy shift was associated with a 14% higher risk of frequent mental distress and an 11% higher risk of any indications of poor mental health.
The study can’t prove that policy changes or arrest rates might directly impact mental health. Another limitation is that researchers lacked data on whether individual participants had experienced discrimination or were aware of immigration arrests or impacted personally by the policy changes.
The researchers also couldn’t account for any connection between changes in state-level immigration arrests and the proportion of undocumented residents.
“Additional research and, more important, public health action are urgently needed to mitigate the damaging effects of intensified anti-immigration enforcement measures and restrictive immigration policies on health,” the researchers conclude.

For the first time the annual risk report, compiled by the World Economic Forum (WEF), found the top five concerns were all environmental, from extreme weather to biodiversity loss and events like oil spills and radioactive contamination.
That came as trade wars and the rise of nationalist politics around the world were also cited by the panel of more than 750 experts and decision-makers surveyed as making it harder for countries to work together on solutions.
This year’s Davos takes place against the backdrop of some of Australia’s worst ever bushfires. While the government there has avoided making a link to climate change, the fires have added to public concern about the heating of the planet.
“The visibility of the impact of extreme weather events, wild fires, flooding, has heightened awareness,” said Emily Farnworth, WEF Head of Climate Change Initiatives.
“What we are now seeing is the reality of what it means.”
This year’s Davos, which runs next week, has chosen sustainability as its main theme and comes as campaigners such as Greta Thunberg ramp up pressure on business and governments.
BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink on Tuesday warned company boards to step up efforts to tackle climate change, seen as a big shift by the world’s top asset manager.

At the same time, leading economies are behind on pledges to cut carbon emissions made with the 2015 Paris Agreement and activists remain wary of empty promises, pointing to the huge subsidies and private funds still on offer for fossil fuels.
U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to attend, although some world leaders will skip this year’s Davos. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told his ministers to avoid an event seen by many as elitist.
CARBON NEUTRAL
In a bid to preempt criticism that its jetset guests are part of the problem, the WEF said this year’s Davos would use offsets to be fully carbon neutral, line up more electric vehicles and offer local food and non-meat protein options.
WEF founder and executive chairman Klaus Schwab also announced plans to launch a scheme using public and private funds to plant one trillion trees by the end of this decade.
Environmental concerns have been rising up the list of its perceived long-term risks, a marked change from a decade ago when the West’s biggest economies were thrown into recession by the financial crisis.
The biggest risk that year was seen as a fresh collapse in asset prices, while inequality was the top concern from 2012 to 2014. Immigration loomed large in the 2016 survey as hundreds of thousands of migrants arrived in Europe, fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa.
Aside from the environment, the 2020 survey highlights concerns about shortfalls in governance of the technology sector, struggling health sectors and doggedly high inequality.

In its methodology for the survey, the WEF said a “global risk” was defined as one that could cause major harm to several countries or industries within the next 10 years.

(Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden promised black community leaders in Delaware on Monday he would earn their support amid nationwide police brutality protests, saying he would create a police oversight board within his first 100 days in the White House.
Biden, who met with more than a dozen black leaders in a church in Wilmington, also said he would soon unveil an economic plan to deal with the disproportionate toll on the black and Latino communities from the coronavirus outbreak.
“I’ve never taken you for granted,” Biden, who visited a protest site on Sunday, told the leaders after sitting quietly and taking note of their concerns. “It has to be earned, earned every single time.”
Cities across the country awoke from a smoldering weekend of violent protests over race and policing sparked by the death of a black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody last Monday.
Biden said his economic plan would include components on housing, education and access to capital in the black community.
“We’re going to make sure that the economic recovery deals with the institutional structures, the institutional racism,” said Biden, who wore a mask as he listened and pulled it down to talk.
Biden’s appearance was a contrast with the approach of Republican President Donald Trump, who has made no major public statement to address the growing crisis but issued tweets as he remained out of sight in the White House. He was due on Monday to meet his top law enforcement officer and hold a call with governors, law enforcement and national security officials.
The community leaders at Wilmington’s Bethel AME Church urged Biden to pick a black vice presidential running mate, and said the protests were a reflection of frustration about the lack of attention and resources for African-American communities.
“Young people out there are going mad” from a lack of effort to address their problems, said Bishop Thomas Wesley Weeks, pastor at New Destiny Fellowship in Wilmington. Weeks and others said the choice of a black running mate would show Biden’s commitment to one of the Democratic Party’s most loyal constituencies.
“A black female will overwhelm and excite and turn the heads of these young people and everybody out there,” Weeks said.
Biden, who has promised his No. 2 will be a woman, told the group several black women were on his list of potential running mates.
Last month, Biden apologized for telling a black radio host that he “ain’t black” if he was still weighing whether to support him or Trump in the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election.

Biden has chafed at being stuck in his Delaware home during the coronavirus outbreak, and a Biden adviser said there was an internal divide on whether to get Biden out on the trail, with his wife Jill resisting.
“I can tell you with confidence that Joe wants to get out there, Jill doesn’t want him too. She knows her husband and it’s impossible for him not hug or handshake,” the adviser said.
Floyd’s death was the latest in a string of similar incidents involving unarmed black men in recent years that have raised an outcry over excessive police force and racism.",['contrast']

Anger spread to Britain, where scores of people gathered in the Strand in central London to denounce Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, branded by one placard as a “fossil fool”.
The bushfire crisis has added pressure on Morrison’s conservative government to do more to combat climate change after Australia weakened its commitment to the U.N. Paris climate accord last year.
Friday’s demonstrations came as authorities urged nearly a quarter of a million people to flee their homes and prepared military backup as soaring temperatures and erratic winds fanned bushfires across the east coast.
Major roads in Sydney were blocked as protesters chanted “ScoMo has got to go”, referring to Morrison, while placard read ‘Save us from hell’.
There were similar protests in Canberra, the capital, and Melbourne, where air quality turned so noxious this month that the two cities featured among places with the most polluted air on earth.
More than 100 people chanted slogans outside the Australian High Commission in London. Banners said “Stop Killing our Planet (PLEASE)” and “Inaction against climate change, that’s just not cricket”.
Extinction Rebellion protesters joined the demonstration, blocking the road, banging drums and holding up traffic. A food trailer attached to a bike handed out free hot vegan food.

Londoner Peter Cole, 76, held up a sign saying “Climate Change Denier Scott Morrison Fiddles while Australia Burns”.
“I’m here because the Australian government is doing absolutely nothing to combat climate change. In fact they’re largely denying it and they need to be put under a lot of pressure...”
Morrison has repeatedly rejected criticism that his government is not doing enough. On Friday, he told Sydney radio 2GB that it was disappointing that people were conflating the bushfire crisis with Australia’s emission reduction targets.
“We don’t want job-destroying, economy-destroying, economy-wrecking targets and goals, which won’t change the fact that there have been bushfires or anything like that in Australia,” he said.
The CEO of German engineering giant Siemens said it will decide by Monday on its involvement in the development of a controversial Australian coal mine. Joe Kaeser was speaking after meeting climate activist Luisa Neubauer.
Friday’s protests in Australia stirred debate, with Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews saying they were wrongly timed and would divert police resources.
“Common sense tells you that there are other times to make your point,” he told a televised briefing.
“I respect people’s right to have a view, I tend to agree with a lot of the points that are being made - climate change is real - but there is a time and a place for everything and I just don’t think a protest tonight was the appropriate thing.”

Philadelphia and Northampton counties first used the new “ExpressVote XL” machines in last November’s local elections and will deploy them again in the presidential nominating contests and local races on Tuesday. A third county, Cumberland, will use the machines for the first time.
Their first widespread use in 2019 in Pennsylvania was marred by miscounted vote tallies in Northampton, a politically divided county in eastern Pennsylvania. Some ExpressVote XL machines incorrectly recorded votes for several candidates in the November election, prompting the county to count backup paper receipts to identify the correct winners, according to Maudeania Hornik, chair of the Northampton Election Commission.
The manufacturer of the ExpressVote XL equipment said in a December press conference that some of Northampton’s 320 machines “were configured improperly at our factory prior to delivery to Northampton County.” The manufacturer told the county as many as 30% of the machines were affected, Hornik said.
Problems with at least 366 ExpressVote XL machines also arose in Philadelphia, according to public records exclusively obtained by Reuters. The city last year replaced its old voting equipment with a new fleet of 3,750 ExpressVote XL machines. Reuters could not ascertain how many of those machines were deployed in the November 2019 election there.
Philadelphia is home to 20% of registered Democrats in Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state that could determine who wins the presidency in November.
Poll workers and technicians reported issues with the new machines at more than 40% of polling locations in Philadelphia during last November’s election, according to the records reviewed by Reuters. Problems included touchscreens that were hypersensitive or that froze; paper voting receipts getting jammed in the machines; and panels opening on some machines to expose the equipment’s electronic controls, the records show.
Katina Granger, a spokeswoman for the ExpressVote XL’s manufacturer, ES&S, said the company was “wholly confident” in the machines, and that it was “simply inaccurate” for anyone to imply there were widespread issues with the ExpressVote XL.
The machines face a big test on Tuesday. After Pennsylvania postponed its 2020 primary originally scheduled for April due to COVID-19 pandemic fears, Philadelphia reduced its in-person polling sites to 190 locations, down from more than 800 that would typically be operating. Those sites are more concentrated in neighborhoods dominated by low-income and minority voters, U.S. Census data show. Pennsylvania allows residents to vote by mail for any reason, but just 20% of Philadelphia’s electorate requested absentee ballots for the June 2 contest.

Philadelphia, Northampton and Cumberland, in central Pennsylvania, have yet to announce if the machines will also be used in November’s presidential race between Republican President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Counties typically avoid switching voting systems in major election years.
Reuters reviewed records of 605 phone calls from Philadelphia poll workers who reported problems with the ExpressVote XL machines last November to an Election Day technical help line run by the city. Reuters also spoke with 13 poll workers and voters who said they experienced some of those issues firsthand.
Reuters received copies of the call records — known as “trouble cards” — from four Philadelphia voters, two of whom are among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit demanding Pennsylvania end use of the machines. The case, which was brought by two nonpartisan election integrity groups and several voters, is currently pending in a Pennsylvania state court.
Philadelphia Deputy City Commissioner Nick Custodio made the records available to the voters in accordance with a law that allows Pennsylvania voters to view and copy such information.
When asked for comment about the trouble cards, Custodio said there were fewer and less serious calls about the ExpressVote XL machines in November 2019 than there had been about the city’s previous machines in past elections. Custodio did not address the number of trouble cards, or provide comparable totals of trouble cards from previous elections.
In an email to Reuters, he called the city’s experience with the new voting equipment “overwhelmingly positive,” and also said the news agency had engaged in “bias (sic) fact gathering” by obtaining copies of some records from the two voters who are plaintiffs in the state lawsuit. Reuters requested the records under Pennsylvania’s right-to-know law. Philadelphia’s deputy solicitor turned down that request, citing a state law that said the records “may be inspected and copied by any qualified elector of the county,” meaning Pennsylvania voters. Reuters then asked some voters to copy and share them with the news agency, four of whom did so.
Matthew Lilly, president of a company that serviced the old voting machines in Philadelphia that were replaced by the ExpressVote XLs, disputed Custodio’s assertion that previous elections generated more machine issues. Lilly said that in his two decades working with the city, he did not recall any election that resulted in more than 500 trouble cards.
Reuters could not independently confirm how many trouble cards Philadelphia’s voting machines typically generated in previous elections.
ES&S spokeswoman Granger said “additional quality control and training have been instituted” for the Pennsylvania machines since November.
Based in Omaha, Nebraska, ES&S is one of the largest election-machine manufacturers in the United States. The company released the ExpressVote XL in 2018. The machine was a successor to its earlier ExpressVote model that is used by 1,838 counties around the country.
When voting on an ExpressVote XL machine, voters insert a blank page into the machine and make their choices by tapping an interactive screen. The machine then prints a receipt for voters to review, with their choices listed both in human-readable text along with an accompanying barcode that represents each candidate they selected. The machine uses the barcodes to tabulate results.
Even before last November, some election security experts in Pennsylvania raised concerns that ExpressVote XL machines are vulnerable to vote tampering, in part because voters have no way of knowing if those barcodes accurately reflect the candidates for whom they voted. Separate from the state suit, a different group of voter advocates filed a federal suit to stop Pennsylvania from using the machines over similar concerns.
A federal judge in Pennsylvania dismissed that suit in April, saying plaintiffs had not proven the machines were recording votes incorrectly or were vulnerable to being hacked.
Marian Schneider, who served as Pennsylvania’s deputy secretary for Elections and Administration from February 2015 until May 2017, said that “hiccups” could be expected with the rollout of any new voting system.
“But this number of trouble cards recorded in a low-turnout election year (2019) is concerning,” said Schneider, who is currently president of Verified Voting, a secure voting technology advocacy group. Schneider is not part of litigation involving the ExpressVote XL machines.
West Philadelphia voter Susie Mizelle told Reuters she was shocked last November to see a panel on top of her ExpressVote XL open, with a USB drive and a power button visible. Mizelle, 44, asked precinct captain Thelma Peake why the machine’s internal system was accessible to voters. Peake told her the panels on the machines kept “popping open,” according to both women.
Peake said she eventually got the panel closed, but it remained “easy to tamper with.”
ExpressVote XL machines only accept “certified and approved USB flash drives containing encrypted data,” according to ES&S, making it impossible for other devices to “change the election definition or system firmware.”
Three of six counties in New Jersey and Delaware that also use ExpressVote XL machines said they had not experienced any problems with them. Combined, they have used 700 machines so far.
“There were no issues relative to tabulating the votes, or how voters marked their votes,” said Nicole DiRado, the elections board administrator of Union County, New Jersey, which has deployed 432 machines in local elections so far.
The other three counties did not respond to requests for comment.
‘ANOTHER CHANCE’
In Philadelphia, at least 1,703 ExpressVote XL machines will be deployed in Tuesday’s election, the city elections board said.
Philadelphia residents who show up in person to vote on June 2 will likely be “older, blacker, and poorer,” said Pennsylvania State Representative Chris Rabb, who also runs Philadelphia’s ninth ward Democratic committee.
Rabb, who last year asked Pennsylvania to investigate concerns that ExpressVote XL machines were not secure, said he was “deeply concerned” that those voters will have to crowd into fewer polling places and use the machines on Tuesday.
Northampton County will deploy 315 machines. It is one of the most competitive counties in America’s presidential battleground states, places set to play an outsized role in November. Cumberland County will operate 384 ExpressVote XL machines.
The three counties are home to 17% of the state’s registered voters and nearly a quarter of its registered Democrats. Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton by less than a percentage point in Pennsylvania in 2016, a narrow victory that helped propel him to the White House.
More than one third of the 605 trouble cards from Philadelphia’s 2019 election showed the ExpressVote XL machines were unusable for some period of time during the voting.
The most frequently reported issues — mentioned in 117 cards — were screen problems, such as screens being too sensitive or not sensitive enough. Two dozen reported security issues, such as panels popping open to reveal software installation areas of the machines.
One in five trouble cards reviewed by Reuters said the city help line had not resolved the issue that prompted the call.
Custodio said in an email that the machines underwent testing before the 2019 election to ensure accuracy, and that the “vast vast majority” of issues with them were solved by phone.
Amanda Feifer, who oversaw Election Day staffing and logistics in a South Philadelphia ward last November, cited issues with touchscreens not highlighting the choices voters tapped. She said it took voters longer to vote than usual, leading to long lines that some voters walked away from.
“Nobody could tell me a story that would convince me that (the machines) were okay, because I witnessed it firsthand,” Feifer said.

Custodio said more than 86% of election judges, the officials who supervise polling places, reported that wait times at their sites were less than 20 minutes, according to a post-election survey conducted by the city. He did not share the survey with Reuters.
Northampton election commission chief Hornik said she was the “Number One supporter” of the ExpressVote XL machines when the county procured them for $2.88 million in 2019.
Her county’s experience last year now has left her fearful about potential, possibly undetectable errors that could affect results. However, the county has not allocated funds to invest in a new voting system, Hornik said, “so we have to give them another chance.”",[]

Athletes awoke to news that several water polo players had been injured in a terrifying accident in the early hours of Saturday morning when the second floor of a nightclub came down on the heads of revelers below.
The athletes, who had been letting off steam at the end of their tournament, escaped serious injury but two South Koreans were killed.
There was more bad news later in the day when Australian freestyle swimmer Shayna Jack, who had withdrawn from the worlds just before the meet began, said she had tested positive for a banned substance.
The positive test comes as a major embarrassment to Australian swimming given the headline-grabbing podium protest that 400 freestyle silver medalist Mack Horton made on Sunday over Sun Yang’s participation at the worlds.
The Chinese swimmer, who served a doping sanction in 2014 and was labeled a “drug cheat” by Horton at the Rio Olympics, is competing under the shadow of a World Anti-Doping Agency appeal against FINA’s decision to clear him of wrongdoing during a random drug test last September.
Sun said he did not deserve “insult and slander” from rival swimmers and that he did not violate any rules during a controversial doping test last year.
Australian freestyler Cate Campbell said Jack’s absence was proof of her team’s anti-doping commitment.
“I think that once more information comes to light we can pass judgement but at the moment the Australia team stands for clean sport and unfortunately that is why Shayna is not with us,” she said.
DRESSEL ON FIRE
While Australia were left reeling by the positive test, the U.S. team focused their energies on the pursuit of gold.

Sprint sensation Dressel, who had already won three gold medals in Gwangju, added the 50 freestyle and 100 butterfly titles to his collection before helping the Americans to victory in the mixed 4x100 freestyle relay.
The 22-year-old has been the big story of the championships, grabbing golds and breaking world records in the manner of Olympic great Michael Phelps.
Dressel now has 13 world titles from two world championships. Phelps won 26 golds from six appearances at the worlds.
Freestyle queen Katie Ledecky finally got to the top of the podium in South Korea, holding off a brave challenge from Italian Simona Quadarella in the 800.
Ledecky had surrendered her 400 title to Australian Ariarne Titmus earlier in the week before pulling out of the 200 heats and 1,500 final due to medical reasons.
Unfortunately for Quadarella, who won the 1,500 in Ledecky’s absence, the closing speed that had deserted the American in the 400 had returned.
“I took it out like I usually do and just kind of relied on my training to bring me home,” she said.
“Simona was having a great race and pulled up right next to me and when she did that I kind of felt like I could stick with her and rely on my speed.”
A night after setting a world record in the semi-finals of the women’s 200 backstroke, 17-year-old American Regan Smith returned to win the final, while the mixed 4x100 freestyle saw the U.S. team win their fifth gold of the night.
The only world title to escape the Americans’ clutches on Saturday was the women’s 50 butterfly, which went to Sarah Sjostrom - the Swede’s first gold of the meet.
“I’m very happy that I could win another gold medal especially after such a tough program I’ve been having,” said the Olympic 100 butterfly champion, who had needed an oxygen mask after winning bronze in the 200 freestyle.

The annual Global Risks Report, which incorporates the survey, highlighted several top risks for 2019 including massive incidents of data fraud and theft and large scale cyberattacks.
But the top risk by likelihood in the survey was extreme weather, in a survey of 1,000 experts from government, business, academia and non-governmental organizations. And the risk that failure by governments to limit the magnitude of climate change and adapt to it has risen to second place in terms of both likelihood and impact, compared to only fifth place and fourth place in those categories last year in the survey.
“Of all risks, it is in relation to the environment that the world is most clearly sleepwalking into catastrophe,” said the report.
After 200 countries, including the United States, agreed to tackle climate change in 2015 at U.N. talks in Paris, worries in the survey about governmental failure to tackle global warming fell.
But that has changed after U.S. President Donald Trump announced in 2017 his intention to pull out of the Paris agreement, a move he emphasized in 2018. In addition, deadly wildfires in Greece and California and hurricanes in Florida and North Carolina were frequently in the news.
“People ... are beginning to understand increasingly the gravity of the situation and that the Paris Agreement, even if fully implemented, cannot be seen as a panacea,” Aengus Collins, the report’s author and project leader told Reuters.
The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in October said global temperatures are likely to rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052 if global warming continues at its current pace and if the world fails to take rapid and unprecedented measures.
And U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide spiked 3.4 percent last year after falling for the previous three, the Rhodium Group, an independent research group, said last week.
Trump, who attended last year’s talks in Davos, plans to send Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to the talks that begin Jan. 22 as he grapples with Democrats over a partial government shutdown.
The report said rapidly growing coastal cities, particularly in Asia, are making people more vulnerable to climate change. A “vicious circle” of urbanization concentrates people and buildings in areas of potential damage, while also increasing risks, by destroying natural sources of resilience, such as mangrove forests, or increasing strain on groundwater reserves, it said.",['extreme']
110,The man behind a petition drive to recall a California state senator and physician pushing for tougher vaccine requirements was charged on Wednesday with assault after livestreaming himself shoving the lawmaker in a sidewalk confrontation in Sacramento.,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-crime-vaccines/anti-vaccine-activist-charged-for-assault-of-california-senator-idUSKCN1VC06U,reuters,vaccines,center,6,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - The man behind a petition drive to recall a California state senator and physician pushing for tougher vaccine requirements was charged on Wednesday with assault after livestreaming himself shoving the lawmaker in a sidewalk confrontation in Sacramento.
Kenneth Austin Bennett, 54, known for presenting his anti-vaccine views and various conspiracy theories on social media, posted self-recorded video on his own Facebook page showing him accosting Senator Richard Pan during what appears as a chance encounter on the street.
Bennett is seen immediately unleashing a tirade against Pan as he walks beside the politician, who tries to ignore, then laugh off his antagonist. Bennett then thrusts his hand into the lawmaker’s back and pushes him sharply from behind, sending Pan stumbling forward.
The lawmaker whips around to briefly face Bennett, pointing his fingers at him, shouting “Hey, hey,” then turns back around abruptly and walks away as he and a companion take out their cell phones, presumably to report the incident.
Pan, a Sacramento Democrat and medical doctor, is then seen ducking into a nearby restaurant. Bennett continues the livestream, filming himself as he acknowledges out loud, “I probably shouldn’t have done that.”
He goes on to accuse Pan of “poisoning our children,” adding, “If he got what he deserved, he would be hanged for treason, for assaulting children, for misrepresenting the truth.”
Bennett mounted an unsuccessful primary election challenge to Pan in 2018 and failed to qualify for the general election. In May, he launched a recall campaign against Pan, filing a petition accusing him of “high treason” for authoring legislation to restrict vaccine exemptions for school children.
Sacramento police called to investigate Wednesday’s confrontation, which occurred blocks away from the state Capitol, cited Bennett with misdemeanor assault, and he was released, police spokesman Marcus Basquez said.
Pan was not hurt, Basquez said.
State Senate President pro Tempore Toni Atkins later decried the incident in a statement saying fellow legislators would assist in investigating the matter.
“There is absolutely no reason for resorting to violence,” she said. “This is a place where laws are meant to be made, not broken.”
Pan’s spokeswoman, Shannan Velayas, was quoted by the Los Angeles Times as saying her boss has routinely been targeted by anti-vaccine activists since he introduced a bill in 2015 creating strict vaccine requirements for school children.
She said his more recent bill to further tighten vaccine laws has prompted a new round of threats.
“This is moving from a peculiar fringe curiosity to a violent extremist movement,” Velayas told the newspaper.",[]
112,BBC Presenter Gabby Logan has said that it is not fair that transgender women can compete in sport alongside biologically female women.,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/MUn-1N_pc3I/,breitbart,sport,right,6,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"BBC Presenter Gabby Logan has said that it is not fair that transgender women can compete in sport alongside biologically female women.
Logan, who represented Wales in Rhythmic Gymnastics at the 1990 Commonwealth Games, said women’s sport needs to be “protected” and said many other athletes “feel the same way.” She stressed “This is not about attacking a community, it’s about saying: how can we make this a fair place for women to compete?”, reports the Mirror newspaper.
Her comments come as other famous sporting women including Sharon Davies and Martina Navratilova have spoken out against the unfairness of trans athletes competing against biological women.
British Olympic swimmer Davies said there were “fundamental differences” between the sexes and that it was not an example of a “fair and level playing field”.
She continued “I have nothing against anyone who wishes 2be transgender… However I believe there is a fundamental difference between the binary sex u r born with & the gender u may identify as. To protect women’s sport those with a male sex advantage should not be able 2compete in women’s sport.”
Meanwhile, Tennis Legend Martina Navratilova, a gay rights activist, wrote a column for the Sunday Times in which she said: “I am happy to address a transgender woman in whatever form she prefers, but I would not be happy to compete against her.” Navratilova added that it was “cheating”.
Their comments have faced serious backlash. One British sports columnist, Jonathan Liew of the Independent, said of the issue that it “falls under the most literal definition of transphobia: an irrational fear of the other, based on ingrained prejudice and occasionally pure ignorance”.
Rachel Mckinnon, a transgender college professor at Charleston College in the US, said that excluding trans athletes was like excluding black women “If Sharron Davies, Paula Radcliffe, or Martina Navratilova had said we need to keep black women out of sport to “protect it” and the “integrity of women’s sport that would be obviously racist. That’s why it’s obviously transphobic to exclude trans women now”
One school in the US has withdrawn from their athletic conference entirely over the issue. Grace Brethren Christian School Director George Hornickel stated that trans athletes competing as women was “a form of cheating” and that it “gives them an advantage over girls teams who only play female athletes.”","['fair', 'female']"
115,"A humanitarian ship that has had about 230 rescued migrants on board for almost a week will enter a Maltese port on Wednesday, ending a standoff with Italy which refused to let the ship dock.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-malta-lifeline/malta-to-allow-migrant-rescue-ship-to-dock-ending-standoff-idUSKBN1JN1TJ,reuters,immigration,center,6,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"CASTILLE, Malta (Reuters) - A humanitarian ship that has had about 230 rescued migrants on board for almost a week will enter a Maltese port on Wednesday, ending a standoff with Italy which refused to let the ship dock.

Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said seven European Union countries had offered to share the burden of the migrants with Malta. The Lifeline ship, operated by German charity Mission Lifeline, was due to dock at around 1600 GMT.
Migration has become an urgent political issue across the EU in recent weeks, since the new Italian government took power earlier this month and Germany’s ruling coalition split over the issue.
“Lifeline will be granted permission to enter a Maltese port, where procedures for identification, ascertaining their asylum eligibility, and distribution to other member states will start immediately,” Muscat told reporters.
“The Maltese government took the lead on a solution before the situation escalated to a humanitarian crisis,” he added, emphasizing, however, that the small island nation was not legally bound to take in the vessel.
The Lifeline is the second charity ship that Italy has shut out of its ports this month after the new anti-immigrant Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said private rescue vessels would no longer be welcome because they “cannot dictate Italy’s immigration policy”.
Muscat said that permitting the ship to dock in Malta was a one-time, or “ad-hoc”, resolution to the standoff. While 650,000 migrants have arrived in Italy by sea since 2014, Malta has allowed in only those needing urgent medical care.
A summit between EU leaders that will tackle the bloc’s common framework for managing migration will be held in Brussels on Thursday and Friday.
Germany was not among the countries that agreed to take in some of the migrants on the Lifeline.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, leader of the Bavarian conservatives whose hardline stance on migration has pushed Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition to the brink of collapse, told lawmakers in Berlin there was no need for Germany to take in any of the migrants since other countries had volunteered.
He said the case underscored the need for common European guidelines on migration, and the most “humane and Christian” solution was to combat the causes of migration and flight.
Italy, Ireland, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands and Portugal “agreed to collaborate to offer a European solution” for the ship, a statement from Muscat’s office said.
“This is a great victory,” Italian Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli said on Twitter, while Salvini called it “another success of the Italian government”.
The ship will be detained and the captain questioned, Muscat said, because of its refusal to leave the migrant boats to be intercepted by the Libyan coastguard, as it had been told to do by Italian authorities.
Lifeline has repeatedly said that allowing the Libyan coastguard to take the migrants back would have broken international law because the North African country is unsafe for them.
Germany’s Seehofer said migrants picked up in the Mediterranean should be returned to “robust protective zones” when they could receive aid and legal processes could occur.",['standoff']
119,Tensions between Trump and the messaging platform escalated last week after Twitter began to label some of his tweets with a fact-check. Trump responded with an executive order that threatens to curtail some legal protections enjoyed by social media companies.,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump/with-rallies-halted-and-tweets-fact-checked-trump-campaign-turns-to-smartphone-app-idUSKBN2391FT,reuters,elections-2020,center,6,2,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Should President Donald Trump and Twitter ultimately part ways, his campaign has a backup plan at the ready to get his voice out.
Tensions between Trump and the messaging platform escalated last week after Twitter began to label some of his tweets with a fact-check. Trump responded with an executive order that threatens to curtail some legal protections enjoyed by social media companies.
Trump’s campaign has been building an alternative channel for him for months, a smartphone app that aims to become a one-stop news, information and entertainment platform for his supporters, in part because of concerns that the president would lose access to the Twitter platform, said his campaign manager, Brad Parscale.
The Trump app, which was launched in April, has since often placed among the Top 10 in Apple’s rankings of news apps, sometimes above those of individual news organizations such as CNN, the New York Times and Reuters.
“We have always been worried about Twitter and Facebook taking us offline and this serves as a backup,” Parscale told Reuters.
He spoke before Twitter for the first time prompted readers to check the facts in Trump’s tweets last week, warning that his claims about mail-in ballots were false and had been debunked by fact checkers.
For supporters, the new app is where they can get the latest campaign news, watch campaign-produced, prime-time shows hosted by Trump allies and earn reward points for making phone calls or signing people up for the app.
For the campaign, it is a pandemic-proof substitute to Trump’s signature rallies, and a key tool to collect crucial data that can help micro-target voters ahead of November’s election. Trump will face presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 contest.
With millions of Americans stuck at home and campaign rallies paused due to the coronavirus, successful digital organizing can make a difference, digital strategists in both parties say.
Signing into the app requires a cellphone number, which then allows the campaign to send the user regular text messages lauding Trump or asking for donations.
“The most important, golden thing in politics is a cellphone number,” said Parscale, who ran Trump’s digital efforts in 2016 before leading the 2020 campaign. “When we receive cellphone numbers, it really allows us to identify them across the databases. Who are they, voting history, everything.”
Reward points that users can earn by getting other people to sign up for the app can be used to buy campaign gear or even score a meeting with Trump himself, the campaign said.

‘DIGITAL MOUSETRAP’
Biden’s campaign has a phone app as well, where supporters can donate or volunteer, and text people directly with campaign messaging.
But unlike Trump’s app, it provides little information, such as social media streams or news releases. Nor does it connect to the virtual campaign events Biden has been holding nearly daily during the coronavirus pandemic. The app is not ranked by Apple as among its 200 most popular for news.
The Biden campaign said it uses its app almost solely for organizing supporters, not for pushing content.
By contrast, according to Stefan Smith, a Democratic digital strategist who worked for Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 presidential campaign, the Trump app has created a “walled garden” or “digital mousetrap” where voters ideally stay as long as possible, interacting with the app’s steady stream of content.
“The Trump campaign is a media company with an electoral component,” Smith said.
The Trump campaign hired Texas-based company Phunware (PHUN.O) to build the app.
If they so choose, users can rely on the app as a primary, if heavily filtered, information source, one where Trump’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic is championed and the economy is poised for a quick recovery and the federal probe into Trump’s collusion with Russia was a politically motivated hoax.
Not included is less favorable coverage of the president. On Monday, the app contained a campaign statement framed like a news article that said Trump had been working to unite the county in the wake of nationwide protests over the police shooting of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
There was no mention of a combative conference call Trump had with U.S. governors in which he urged them to act more aggressively toward the protesters.
Bill Bigby, a Trump supporter in Scranton, Pennsylvania, said the app has now become his go-to source for the latest news.
“We have learned that you can’t trust anything the media says about Trump,” Bigby, 56, said. “They just don’t like him.”

“It won’t be enough just to defend the Greek-Turkish border,” said Orban, a staunch anti-immigrant populist.
“As a last resort, as in 2015, there are the Hungarians,” he said. “Even if Greece’s attempt is successful, the EU border must be defended...which Hungary will do,” he told a news conference with Central European leaders.
Turkey, alarmed by the prospect of another wave of refugees fleeing war in northwest Syria, said last week it will no longer uphold a 2016 deal with the EU to keep hundreds of thousands of migrants on its soil in return for EU aid.
Since then, more than 10,000 migrants - mostly from Syria, other Middle Eastern states and Afghanistan - have massed on the Greek border hoping to get to western Europe. Greek security forces have used tear gas to stop them crossing.
“We will give all the help we can for Greece to stop this...Orban said. “We must do something about (them).”
Orban has campaigned for years to draw up strong EU defenses and deal with migrants in Africa and Asia, before they ever reach European soil. He said on Wednesday that about 130,000 migrants were already in the Balkans from previous influxes.
Europe should follow the policies Hungary adopted years ago, he said.
In 2015, at the height of the migrant crisis, Orban had a razor wire fence built along Hungary’s southern border, complete with sensors, floodlights and frequent patrols by border forces.
The fence has been criticized for years as has Orban’s policy to turn back virtually all migrants at the border, sometimes by depriving them of food in holding zones at border crossings.
Migrants have trickled through the Balkans for years. Their numbers have picked up behind the fence in recent months and an increasing number of them have been trying to breach it, police figures show.","['staunch', 'populist', 'anti-immigrant']"

Washington already has sent more than 56,000 migrants to Mexico under the program, known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP). The majority have been Central Americans applying for U.S. asylum.
The effort — which had been implemented over the past year at ports of entry in Texas and California — will be applied at a port of entry south of Tucson, Ariz. Previously, migrants encountered in that area had been sent to El Paso, Texas, to process their return to Mexico.
U.S. President Donald Trump has made immigration enforcement a major focus of his first term in office and has continued to press the issue in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election.
Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf said in a written statement on Thursday that the MPP program has been “an extremely effective tool” for the United States.
Advocates counter that the initiative exposes migrants to violence in Mexico and restricts their ability to seek protections in the United States. The U.S. consulate in Mexico’s border city of Nuevo Laredo issued a security alert on Wednesday, warning against gun battles and urging government employees to take precautions. [L1N297021]
Mexico’s asylum agency, known as COMAR, said on Wednesday that it had received 66,915 applications for asylum in 2019, up nearly 126% from the previous year.
The agency has struggled to process the crush of applications with limited resources. COMAR received 20 million pesos ($1 million) in funding from the Mexican government in 2019, the lowest sum in seven years.
In December, U.S. border authorities expanded a separate program to process asylum cases rapidly to the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, according to CBS News. The program, known as Prompt Asylum Claim Review (PACR), had been launched months earlier as a pilot in the El Paso area.
U.S. authorities have not specified the criteria to place migrants in a growing array of border programs, which include MPP, PACR and another initiative that sends asylum seekers from Honduras and El Salvador to request protection in Guatemala.
Rodney Scott, acting deputy chief of the U.S. Border Patrol, told reporters in December that the factors “change on a daily basis” but are determined in coordination with the receiving countries.",[]

Athletes awoke to news that several water polo players had been injured in a terrifying accident in the early hours of Saturday morning when the second floor of a nightclub came down on the heads of revelers below.
The athletes, who had been letting off steam at the end of their tournament, escaped serious injury but two South Koreans were killed.
There was more bad news later in the day when Australian freestyle swimmer Shayna Jack, who had withdrawn from the worlds just before the meet began, said she had tested positive for a banned substance.
The positive test comes as a major embarrassment to Australian swimming given the headline-grabbing podium protest that 400 freestyle silver medalist Mack Horton made on Sunday over Sun Yang’s participation at the worlds.
The Chinese swimmer, who served a doping sanction in 2014 and was labeled a “drug cheat” by Horton at the Rio Olympics, is competing under the shadow of a World Anti-Doping Agency appeal against FINA’s decision to clear him of wrongdoing during a random drug test last September.
Sun said he did not deserve “insult and slander” from rival swimmers and that he did not violate any rules during a controversial doping test last year.
Australian freestyler Cate Campbell said Jack’s absence was proof of her team’s anti-doping commitment.
“I think that once more information comes to light we can pass judgement but at the moment the Australia team stands for clean sport and unfortunately that is why Shayna is not with us,” she said.
DRESSEL ON FIRE
While Australia were left reeling by the positive test, the U.S. team focused their energies on the pursuit of gold.

Sprint sensation Dressel, who had already won three gold medals in Gwangju, added the 50 freestyle and 100 butterfly titles to his collection before helping the Americans to victory in the mixed 4x100 freestyle relay.
The 22-year-old has been the big story of the championships, grabbing golds and breaking world records in the manner of Olympic great Michael Phelps.
Dressel now has 13 world titles from two world championships. Phelps won 26 golds from six appearances at the worlds.
Freestyle queen Katie Ledecky finally got to the top of the podium in South Korea, holding off a brave challenge from Italian Simona Quadarella in the 800.
Ledecky had surrendered her 400 title to Australian Ariarne Titmus earlier in the week before pulling out of the 200 heats and 1,500 final due to medical reasons.
Unfortunately for Quadarella, who won the 1,500 in Ledecky’s absence, the closing speed that had deserted the American in the 400 had returned.
“I took it out like I usually do and just kind of relied on my training to bring me home,” she said.
“Simona was having a great race and pulled up right next to me and when she did that I kind of felt like I could stick with her and rely on my speed.”

The only world title to escape the Americans’ clutches on Saturday was the women’s 50 butterfly, which went to Sarah Sjostrom - the Swede’s first gold of the meet.

176,"Amid pressure from Washington, Mexico is backpedaling on promises of better treatment for Central American migrants, leaving hundreds stranded in unsanitary camps near its southern border and allegations of irregular detentions.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-mexico/migrant-camps-overflow-as-mexico-cracks-down-after-trump-threats-idUSKCN1RT20U?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews,reuters,immigration,center,9,1,Biased,Entirely factual,"MAPASTEPEC, Mexico (Reuters) - Amid pressure from Washington, Mexico is backpedaling on promises of better treatment for Central American migrants, leaving hundreds stranded in unsanitary camps near its southern border and allegations of irregular detentions.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised more humane treatment for Central American migrants when he took office in December. His left-leaning government issued thousands of year-long humanitarian visas in January, giving migrants legal access to jobs and the right to travel to the United States.
However, caught off guard by a surge in arrivals, Lopez Obrador’s administration is resorting to old tactics based on tough law enforcement.
Mexico has halted the liberal visa policy and ramped up detentions of migrants heading north, government data shows, following criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump of a jump in the number of Central American asylum seekers reaching the U.S. border in February.
Trump, who is expected to make border security central to his 2020 re-election bid, has vowed to limit trade with Mexico if it does not help slow immigration.
While Lopez Obrador’s government has said it will not react to “threats”, sources familiar with Mexican policy, who asked not to be identified, said near-daily U.S. government pressure had led the interior and foreign ministries to push the National Migration Institute (INM) for tougher action.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Unreleased INM data, reviewed by Reuters, showed that it detained 12,746 undocumented migrants for registration in March, up by nearly one-third from February and two-thirds from January.
The agency also stopped processing new applications for humanitarian visas on Jan. 28, after issuing some 13,000 - mostly to Central Americans arriving that month in the southern border state of Chiapas, the site of most migrant arrivals.
A few thousand more visas were issued in February, but none since, said an INM official in Mexico City, who was not officially authorized to speak to the media and asked to remain anonymous.
INM said in a statement earlier this month it remained open to issuing humanitarian visas in Chiapas, with priority given to women, children and the elderly.
In Chiapas, the INM’s decision to close its main office in the border city of Tapachula a month ago has forced hundreds of migrants to travel 65 miles (105 km) north to the smaller town of Mapastepec, where they have languished in sweltering temperatures, hoping for humanitarian visas.
“It’s madness that they’re making us wait so long. For what? For nothing!” said Daisy Maldonado, a 26-year-old from Honduras, camping in a field in Mapastepec opposite a sports stadium.
Hundreds of bedraggled men, women and children have been sheltering for nearly three weeks inside the stadium, as migration officials registered their identities while neglecting the group camped over the road, rights groups and migrants said.
Without water, medical help or government attention, Maldonado’s group was dependent on scant handouts from locals, they said. Maldonado’s daughter, Marisol, 5, wailed with hunger beside her, in a bivouac she had built from dried palm branches.
A coalition of over a dozen human rights and humanitarian aid groups operating in Chiapas has called the buildup of stranded migrants a “humanitarian crisis,” and said the confusion over visas was worsening the plight of migrants.
“The government is responding with practices and repressive methods similar to the previous administration in terms of control and deportation, but in a way that’s even more disorderly,” said Salva Lacruz, a coordinator at Fray Matias de Cordova, a migrant group that operates in Chiapas. “In some ways, it’s worse.”
INM Commissioner Tonatiuh Guillén López said in a recent interview his agency was taking a “stricter” approach in southern Mexico because of the influx of migrants in Chiapas. However, he denied that was a response to U.S. pressure and said Mexico was pressing ahead with more humane migration policies.
‘HUMANITARIAN CRISIS’
INM officials said they closed the main regional office in Tapachula on March 15 after Cuban migrants stormed the premises, enraged that they were not seeing faster results.
Rights groups and migrants, however, dispute this.

Nonetheless, the closure has created a bottleneck of visa applicants, hundreds of whom headed north to Mapastepec.
On Saturday, INM suddenly halted registration at the stadium in Mapastepec and said migrants would have to wait at least a month longer.
INM said work had been stopped after some migrants had caused a disturbance requiring police to intervene and registration would continue at another site, without providing details.
Even those who had been registered inside the stadium had been given no indication from INM officials if or when they would receive humanitarian visas almost two weeks after being processed, said Silvia Rodriguez, 26, a Honduran citizen.
On Wednesday, the INM said it would not issue any humanitarian visas in Mapastepec, but migrants would instead be able to request a seven-day permit to visit Mexico’s southern border states, which would not allow them to journey northward.
It also said migrants would be notified of that once an evaluation of the registrants was completed.
Despite the uncertainty, many migrants preferred to wait to request legal status before continuing their journey in caravans. Migrants who travel alone and without papers in Mexico are frequent prey for kidnappers and smugglers, in addition to risking detention or extortion by police.
Erick Morazan, a 28-year-old from Honduras, said he traveled to Mapastepec by night with a group of other migrants to avoid sweeps by immigration officials, in what he called a “caravan of zombies.”
“Migration officials are grabbing us like pigs,” said Morazan, traveling with two children.
In an effort to stem the build up of migrants in Chiapas, INM said this month that citizens of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala will be able to register for the visas through Mexican consulates in their home countries from late May.
DETENTION OVERCROWDING
While INM closed its registration offices in Tapachula, a detention center at the site remains open. An increase in detentions in the border area means the site is crammed with 1,700 people, the rights collective said in its report.
That’s about double its capacity and double the usual number held there, according to migrant group Fray Matias, which monitors the center.
The collective reported black eyes and bruised bodies among detainees it said were the result of beatings by police who entered the center to control a disturbance last week. Reuters was not able to independently verify this.
Mexican law enforcement representatives did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
Lacruz of Fray Matias said at least 30 migrants had been irregularly detained at the Tapachula facility despite having applied for asylum with the Mexican Refugee Help Commission (COMAR), in contravention of Mexican law.
INM did not respond to requests for comment about the allegations of overcrowding and irregular detentions.
The institute says that migrants held in its facilities are not detained but are simply being held for processing, though rights groups and migrants say they are not free to leave, often for days or weeks.
Many undocumented migrants are also deported after processing in the centers. Mexico flew about 60 Cubans back to the island this month and sent 204 Hondurans home on Saturday..
Richard Pioenza, a U.S. citizen originally from Cuba, said his wife Yildiz Gomez had been held more than 20 days in the center despite having papers showing she had applied for asylum.
“She’s inside. She’s not eating well,” Pioenza said. “She’s sleeping on the floor.”

Reuters was unable to contact Gomez directly.
Pioenza said his wife applied for refugee status after arriving in Mexico in March to ease her passage to the U.S. border where she was planning to apply for asylum from political repression in Cuba.
After a request from Reuters for verification on Gomez and five other cases of suspected irregular detentions, the Mexican refugee agency said on Monday it would send a team to the center.",['backpedaling']

Phoenix’s Oscar speech for Joker was a rambling discourse that veered in several direction before settling on environmental platitudes.
“I think, whether we’re talking about gender inequality or racism or queer rights or indigenous rights or animal rights, we’re talking about the fight against injustice,” he said. “We’re talking about the fight against the belief that one nation, one people, one race, one gender or one species has the right to dominate, control and use and exploit another with impunity.”
The actor then bore down on animal rights, specifically the life cycle of a cow.
“I think that we’ve become very disconnected from the natural world, and many of us, what we’re guilty of is an egocentric worldview — the belief that we’re the center of the universe,” he said.
“We go into the natural world, and we plunder it for its resources. We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow, and when she gives birth, we steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakable. Then, we take her milk, that’s intended for her calf, and we put it in our coffee and our cereal, and I think we fear the idea of personal change because we think that we have to sacrifice something to give something up.”

This is true regardless of climbers’ confidence, experience, training or climbing frequency, researchers wrote in the journal Wilderness and Environmental Medicine.
“More people are climbing and learning in non-traditional ways, so we thought there might be a gap in the safety skills that are being learned,” said Dr. Alana Hawley, an emergency medicine doctor at Penticton Regional Hospital in British Columbia, who led the study during a wilderness medicine fellowship in Utah.
“There is inherent risk in rock climbing, and climbers should be self-reliant,” she told Reuters Health by phone. “When you need to be rescued, you put others at risk as well.”
Hawley and colleagues at the University of Utah School of Medicine surveyed 25 climbers from climbing gyms in Salt Lake City about their climbing history and confidence in their rescue skills. Climbers were then evaluated on three rescue scenarios in an indoor climbing gym. One scenario involved escaping a belay, or removing themselves from the rope safety system to call for help or start a rescue. Another required them to improvise a belay using a Munter hitch, or a specialized knot that allows them to belay if the primary device is inaccessible. The third scenario required them to ascend a fixed rope, which would be needed to reach an injured climber above or if a climber had rappelled into the wrong place or with an inappropriately short rope.
On average, the climbers had nearly seven years of experience. On a 7-point scale, the average confidence level was 4 to 4.5.
But only 24 percent of climbers passed all three scenarios. About 28 percent could escape a belay, 68 percent could improvise a belay, and 52 percent could ascend the fixed rope.
“The end result was striking because we expected the climbers to have these skills,” Hawley said. “Even they were surprised. They had done this before, but when put to the test, they didn’t know how to do it.”
Climbing courses and gyms should teach basic self-rescue skills and outdoor training, Hawley’s team writes, and coordinate with groups such as the American Mountain Guides Association or the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations. At the same time, climbers who feel confident in their skills may be unaware of the training they still need, the authors add.
“With the boom in popularity in climbing, I’m not surprised to see these results,” said Dr. Aram Attarian, a retired professor from North Carolina State University’s Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management in Raleigh, North Carolina. Attarian, who wasn’t involved with this study, researched climbers’ self-perceptions of safety and rescue skills in 2002.
“Technology has advanced so quickly that it encourages people to get out and do more,” he told Reuters Health by phone. “People think that if they get lost or in a tough spot, they can use their phone or push a panic button on their personal locator beacon.”
Outdoor sports have become more popular among youth groups, especially with activities such as geocaching that incorporate both physical activity and mobile devices. Colleges and universities have stepped up their offerings around outdoor climbing clubs, too, he said.
“Previously, most climbers got into the sport through a mentor who guided them, but now you see less of that since instructional videos are online and you can buy any gear you want at stores like REI,” Attarian said. “Instead, we need more mentors showing people how to improvise, tie knots and become acquainted with environmental dangers.”

226,"Donald Trump became the first U.S. president to attend the annual March for Life in Washington on Friday, unleashing a fierce attack on his Democratic rivals during a rally in an election-year show of support for opponents of abortion rights.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-abortion/at-anti-abortion-rally-trump-assails-democrats-draws-applause-idUSKBN1ZN152?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews,reuters,abortion,center,12,1,No agreement,No agreement,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump became the first U.S. president to attend the annual March for Life in Washington on Friday, unleashing a fierce attack on his Democratic rivals during a rally in an election-year show of support for opponents of abortion rights.
“Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House,” the Republican president told thousands of cheering people at the rally, touting his anti-abortion policies and his appointments of conservatives to the federal judiciary including Supreme Court Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.
Demonstrators from around the country converged on a cool, overcast day in the U.S. capital for the event held annually around the anniversary of the Supreme Court’s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that recognized a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion and legalized the procedure nationwide. Many high school and college students joined in the rally.
Trump, seeking re-election on Nov. 3, addressed the event in the midst of his impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate on charges passed by the Democratic-led House of Representatives. While not mentioning impeachment, he assailed congressional Democrats on abortion policy. Trump drew loud applause from the crowd.
Among his most loyal political supporters are evangelical Christians, who strongly oppose abortion rights. The event took on aspects of a campaign rally, with Trump lashing out at his political opponents and some in the crowd chanting “Four More Years!”
“Sadly, the far left is actively working to erase our God-given rights, shut down faith-based charities, ban religious believers from the public square and silence Americans who believe in the sanctity of life,” Trump said. “They are coming after me because I am fighting for you. And we are fighting for those who have no voice, and we will win.”
“Democrats have embraced the most radical and extreme positions taken and seen in this country for years and decades and you could even say for centuries. Nearly every top Democrat in Congress now supports taxpayer-funded abortion all the way up until the moment of birth,” Trump said, eliciting boos and jeers from the crowd.
Trump, who years earlier had supported abortion rights, cast himself as a committed abortion opponent on religious grounds.
“We know that every human soul is divine and ever human life, born and unborn, is made in the holy image of almighty God,” Trump said.

Trump vowed during the 2016 presidential campaign to appoint justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade.
Abortion remains one of the most divisive issues in the United States. About 58% of U.S. adults say abortion should be legal in most or all cases, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll last year.
Past U.S. presidents have opted to stay away from the march, though Republicans Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both previously delivered remarks to the rally remotely.
The Supreme Court on March 4 will hear arguments in a major case concerning the legality of abortion clinic regulations in Louisiana that could lead to new curbs on access to the procedure. The case will test the willingness of the court, which has a 5-4 conservative majority that includes Trump’s two appointees, to uphold Republican-backed abortion restrictions being pursued in numerous conservative states.
‘BABY HOLOCAUST’
Some at the rally held signs with slogans including “Baby Holocaust,” “Most Pro-Life President Ever,” “Stop Killing Babies” and “I Am The Pro-Life Generation.” Many were from religious groups and conservative nonprofit organizations.
Among them was Anne Fitzgerald, 44, who said that at age 21 she gave up her daughter for adoption so she could finish college. She now runs Days of Tears, a Virginia nonprofit that advocates against abortion, and said she was marching to help women recognize “that in the moment of a decision between raising or aborting a child, adoption is a viable option.”
Fitzgerald said she was at first skeptical of Trump’s stance on abortion, but is proud he turned out to be “strong ally”.
Outside the Supreme Court, anti-abortion demonstrators in the march were met by abortion rights activists, some of whom held signs saying “Keep abortion safe and legal” and “Safe abortion is a human right.” There were also some activists backing Trump’s removal from office.

Emily Goodman, 33, who stood with several fellow supporters of abortion rights during the march, said the event “reeks of a form of religious fundamentalism.”
“What the pro-life advocates seem to be focused on is bussing in young people with signs to declare that their side of the argument is right and no other opinion matters,” said Goodman, who volunteers for a Washington-based nonprofit organization. “I wish there was a conversation today, involving two sides, focused on a woman’s ability to both hold her view on abortion yet not impose that view onto another.”

Warren had previously called for the cancellation of up to $50,000 in student loan debt for each of about 42 million borrowers, but had not outlined the specific steps she would take or the timing.
Warren, writing on the website Medium, said that she would act without waiting for Congress because the Secretary of Education can “use its discretion to wipe away loans even when they do not meet the eligibility criteria for more specific cancellation programs.”
Her campaign offered a letter from experts at Harvard Law School’s legal services center that concluded her plan “calls for a lawful and permissible exercise of the Secretary’s authority under existing law.”
Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, detailed her latest proposal ahead of the seventh Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday evening, when she will be one of six candidates on stage.
Twelve Democrats remain in the nominating race to take on President Donald Trump in November 2020. National opinion polls show Warren in the top tier but trailing former Vice President Joe Biden and fellow U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. She has attempted in recent weeks to regain the momentum her campaign showed during the summer, with nominating contests set to begin in Iowa in early February.
Throughout her year-long presidential campaign, Warren has emphasized affordable college tuition as a way to reduce economic and racial inequality. In April, she rolled out a comprehensive plan to cancel $50,000 in student loan debt for borrowers with annual household incomes below $100,000, with some cancellation for those with household incomes between $100,000 and $250,000.

Warren said on Tuesday that the Higher Education Act, a law passed in 1965, gives the Education Department the ability to act as a “safety valve” for federal student loan programs.
Just 43% of students who attended two-year public colleges and 34% who attended for-profit colleges that began loan repayment in 2011 had begun paying down the principal after five years, Warren said.
Warren, in her proposals and speeches, often ties the high cost of U.S. higher education to decreasing home ownership rates among young adults, fewer individuals starting small businesses, and the so-called “brain drain” facing some rural areas.",[]

243,U.S. immigration officials on Monday deported an Iranian student headed to a Boston university despite efforts by the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocates to block the removal.,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-iran/us-deports-iranian-student-despite-aclu-efforts-to-block-his-removal-idUSKBN1ZK2R2,reuters,immigration,center,13,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. immigration officials on Monday deported an Iranian student headed to a Boston university despite efforts by the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocates to block the removal.
The deportation of Mohammad Shahab Dehghani Hossein Abadi, a 24-year-old Iranian citizen enrolled at Northeastern University, comes after U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced an “enhanced security posture” amid heightened tensions with Iran.
The case had raised new questions about fair treatment of Iranians by immigration authorities under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, called on CBP to halt Abadi’s deportation on Monday night and vowed to fight Trump’s “xenophobic policies.”
Boston-based attorney Kerry Doyle, who took on the case along with attorneys from two other private firms and the ACLU, said Abadi shared immigration paperwork electronically that showed he had been denied entry due to a concern that he would remain in the United States beyond the scope of his student visa.
An official with the Department of Homeland Security said that charge was a “catch all” reason used to deny entrants. The official, who requested anonymity to discuss the case, said border authorities were concerned that Abadi had immediate family members with business ties to Hezbollah, a heavily armed group designated as a terrorist organization by the United States.
Doyle rejected that allegation and said a summary of Abadi’s interview with border authorities suggested confusion over his father’s identity.
“It appeared that there was someone with a similar name or there was some mix-up,” she said.
Boston-based U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs halted Abadi’s removal on Monday for 48 hours after an emergency petition filed by the ACLU. The DHS official said Abadi already had boarded a flight to leave the United States at that point.
Carol Rose, executive director at the ACLU of Massachusetts, argued in a statement on Tuesday that border authorities could have stopped the removal, but “defied a federal court order and deported Shahab without due process.”
Whether CBP officials could have retrieved Abadi from the flight on Monday evening remained unclear.
A second Boston-based federal judge, U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns, said during a hearing on Tuesday that the challenge to Abadi’s detention was moot since he had been removed from the country, according to the ACLU and the DHS official.
VISA CANCELED
Abadi was granted a U.S. student visa approximately one week ago, but had that visa canceled following his arrival at Boston Logan International Airport on Sunday, according to court documents.
Following the Jan. 3 U.S. military strike in Iraq that killed the top Iranian general, Qassem Soleimani, dozens of Iranian Americans with U.S. citizenship or lawful permanent residency were detained by U.S. immigration officials at a border crossing in Washington state.
Local advocacy organizations criticized the detentions - which they said stretched to 12 hours - as unusual and troubling.
CBP said in a Jan. 10 statement that it was operating with an “enhanced security posture” amid tensions with Iran. That came after retaliatory Iranian strikes on bases housing U.S. forces.
The ACLU of Massachusetts said that at least 10 Iranian students had been denied entry at U.S. airports since August 2019, with seven of those denials occurring at Logan International Airport.",[]

Abortion rights groups Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit in July and want a judge to put the law on hold until their legal challenge is heard in court.
The new law, signed by Republican Governor Mike Parson in May and set to take effect on Wednesday, allows for an abortion after the eighth week only in the case of medical emergencies and does not exempt victims of rape or incest.
The law is one of the most restrictive in the United States and activists say it effectively forbids most abortions since many women do not know they are pregnant yet at eight weeks.
The 31-page complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri contends that the legislation is unconstitutional.
“Without this relief, the bans will have a devastating effect on patients seeking access to abortion in the state,” lawyers wrote in the complaint.
In a perennially divisive moral and political fight, similar laws have been proposed in more than a dozen other U.S. states as Republican-controlled legislatures flex their muscles.
Efforts to roll back Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion in 1973, have been emboldened by two appointments by President Donald Trump giving conservatives a solid majority on the court.
Parson said in May the new law would make Missouri “one of the strongest pro-life states in the country.”
Plaintiffs in the Missouri complaint said the law conflicts with more than four decades of binding precedent, would prohibit “the vast majority of pre-viability abortions”, and denied patients healthcare they were entitled to.
Currently the state law allows abortions up until 22 weeks of pregnancy.
Attorneys for the governor’s office, the ACLU and Planned Parenthood were not available for comment early on Monday.","['restrictive', 'forbids', 'most']"

Trump made the announcement on Twitter hours after Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, rejected Republican demands for a full-fledged presidential nominating convention in Charlotte, telling organizers that planning for a scaled-down event was “a necessity” due to the coronavirus.
Cooper “is still in Shelter-In-Place Mode, and not allowing us to occupy the arena as originally anticipated and promised,” Trump said.
“We are now forced to seek another State to host the 2020 Republican National Convention,” Trump said, without indicating which states were under consideration. The convention will nominate Trump to seek a second term in the Nov. 3 election.
In response, Cooper said via Twitter: “It’s unfortunate they never agreed to scale down and make changes to keep people safe.”
Cooper sent an earlier letter to Republican Party leaders a day before the deadline Trump had set for the state to guarantee that convention attendance would not be limited by social distancing restrictions.
Cooper said he could make no such promise for the four-day nominating convention scheduled to open on Aug. 24.
Without knowing how the COVID-19 outbreak will continue to unfold, he said, “planning for a scaled-down convention with fewer people, social distancing and face coverings is a necessity.”
Republican officials had submitted proposals for a “full convention” rather than one with fewer participants and social distancing as requested by the state, Cooper said.
“As much as we want the conditions surrounding COVID-19 to be favorable enough for you to hold the convention you describe in late August, it is very unlikely,” Cooper said.
Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a Twitter post that the party would consider other locations for the convention and “begin visiting the multiple cities and states who have reached out to us.”

Yesterday, one of presidential contender Bernie Sanders’ campaign lackeys tweeted out what should surely be considered one of the worst ideas of this election cycle.
This idea, gaining traction under the hashtag #CancelStudentDebt following the release of Sanders’ college debt forgiveness plan, is bad for several reasons, but naturally appealing in a sort of populist way, since plenty of people choose not to think about second-order impacts and potential consequences of driving our country into even more ruinous national debt than before.
For starters, Gautney, per her Twitter profile, is an associate professor of sociology at Fordham University, a private school located in New York City. None of this is a problem on its own; in a free society, people should be able to tweet whatever dumb things they want while working in whichever industry or field of research.
However, according to publicly available data, associate professors at Fordham make an average of $111,700 per year. This excludes the value of their benefits, so final compensation is a good bit higher. It’s worth noting that the vast majority of professors at Fordham fall into the “associate professor” or “professor” category (full professors make, on average, $159,800 annually). So, 486 of Fordham professors fall into these well-paid and elite categories, while 224 fall into non-six-figures categories (assistant professor, instructor, and lecturer titles).
In other words, living in New York City and making a hefty wad of cash each year isn’t so oppressive, and the majority of Gautney’s colleagues are doing alright. That aside, Gautney consented to this field, job, and city, so if she has an issue with compensation or cost of living, switching to a more lucrative field or cheaper place to live is a decision she should make for herself, not a decision that ought to be bailed out by unsuspecting taxpayers who played no role in the choice.

Sanders’ Grand Plan
Still, plenty of other people have greeted the Sanders plan with fanfare. If elected, Sanders would have taxpayers pay off the $1.6 trillion in student debt held by 45 million Americans. According to Washington Post, he’s “proposing to pay for the legislation with a new tax on financial transactions, including a 0.5 percent tax on stock transactions and a 0.1 percent tax on bonds,” which is a terrible idea in and of itself, as it would disincentivize investing.
What Bernie isn’t proposing to fix is the convergence of factors that lead to the high cost of college. Bailing people out instead of fixing deeper problems would be a foolish mistake. Colleges pump up their endowments and create bloated administrations, then expect students to grapple with enormous price tags.
But things don’t need to be like this: Mitch Daniels, president of Purdue University in Indiana, has frozen tuition at 2012 rates, so incoming freshmen in 2019 are locked into these cheaper prices. Currently, per Forbes, “In inflation-adjusted dollars, Purdue costs $4,000 less per year for out-of-state students than it did when [Daniels] took the job in 2013. In-staters pay nearly $3,000 less, at just under $23,000 this academic year for tuition, room, board and expenses.”
Daniels’ plan hasn’t been free of controversy, but it does make more sense than the current system:
In 2016 he introduced income-share agreements. Students who exhaust federal loans can fund their education with an agreement to sign over a share of their future income, usually between 3% and 5% for up to ten years after they graduate. (Repayments are capped at 2.5 times initial costs.) Critics hate ISAs because they’re unregulated and untested. Milton Friedman is said to have invented the idea but famously noted that they were ‘economically equivalent … to partial slavery.’ Daniels says, ‘If you want indentured servitude, it’s the student-loan program. With ISAs, the risk shifts entirely to the lender,’ since grads who don’t find work pay nothing.
Innovative practices aside, it’s up to consumers to exert pressure on colleges and hold them accountable for such wasteful, bordering on deceitful, practices. There’s no real reason why tuition costs must keep climbing.
Federal Spending Makes Student Costs Way Worse
We can’t pretend federally-subsidized loans don’t play a massive role. Even left-leaning outlets like Slate acknowledge this basic truth, drawing on data published in 2015 by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Brigham Young University:
Looking at both public and private nonprofit colleges during the mid-2000s, they found that schools raised tuition by 55 cents for each $1 increase in Pell grants their undergraduates received, and by 60 to 70 cents for each extra dollar of subsidized student loans. Why would this happen? As the Roosevelt Institute’s Mike Konczal points out, the answer is a little less obvious than you might assume—in a world of rational econo-bots, people aren’t supposed to willingly pay more for an investment, such as a college degree, just because they can get a loan for it.* But the reality is that there are still lots of 18-year-olds who will pay more or less whatever it takes to attend the college of their choice so long as they can find the cash. By letting students borrow more, the government may just be inviting schools to raise tuition, knowing kids simply respond by taking on extra debt.
Still, even with the widespread availability of such subsidized loans, the college debt crisis isn’t necessarily as bad as many claim, which is sure to be unpopular to those who feel like their burden is unjust. Reason’s Nick Gillespie writes, “According to data from Lending Tree, for instance, about 70 percent of the class of 2018 took out loans; their median monthly payment was $222. The average loan amount (which will be higher than the median) for graduates with debt was about $30,000.”
The debt load for those who pursue law or medical school will undoubtedly be higher, and might be stacked on top of existing debt incurred by undergraduate degrees. Still, those who pursue careers in legal or medical fields can look forward to massive returns; in these circumstances, there’s no real need for debt to be forgiven since this is the cost of entry into an ultimately higher-paying field.
For those who pursue advanced degrees out of boredom or difficulty getting a job, with no clearly mapped-out ROI, that debt should also not be forgiven. It’s not taxpayers’ fault that someone spent a lot of money she doesn’t have without a clear vision for how that degree could improve her later financial prospects.
College Admissions Counselors Have Bad Incentives
Then there are the social and cultural factors to consider: we currently have a system where college admissions counselors for high school students have no real skin in the game. If anything, their incentives are completely misaligned, even diametrically opposed, to the incentives of the students they’re supposedly helping. We should push back on this completely idiotic system we’ve created.
Parents and admissions counselors need to recognize that a small dose of tough love now will pay dividends later on. No student should bank on populist election-year whims bailing him out. Instead, parents and college counselors ought to have frank conversations with the students they’re shepherding into adulthood about fiscal responsibility and how student loan payments will factor into these students’ monthly budgets later in life.
There’s also the practical financial component: canceling debt would take $1.6 trillion. The money for this program, and the many others being proposed by the likes of Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, cannot be gotten from taxing just, say, millionaires over a certain threshold—especially since we’re hitting up those millionaire purses for every other thing on the agenda.
You can’t spend the same money twice, although every single Democratic presidential contender seems to be fruitlessly trying. So in order to have this scale of college debt bailout, we would need to tax significant swaths of the population, including a good number of middle- and upper-middle class earners. This sends a very clear message: we care about making the loads of relatively well-off students with decent financial prospects a bit lighter instead of helping much poorer Americans with fewer prospects.
That Sanders’ proposal lacks any sort of means-testing requirement makes it clear that he believes this is something all people deserve, but it’s unclear why, or how that’s a worthwhile investment given that it will be allocated toward those who are relatively rich (or could have been relatively rich had they not gotten a useless master’s degree that doesn’t translate into higher earnings).
""If we #CancelStudentDebt everybody can afford to go to college!"" Umm… *You* wanted to go to college. Others balk at the idea of 4+ years studying topics that bore them. They prefer the trades and starting businesses. Pay for your own preferences. — J.D. Tuccille (@JD_Tuccille) June 25, 2019
Even if all these other points are uncompelling to some, there’s a bigger, broader lesson to be learned here: why are we inviting more intrusion of other people into our personal lives? I think Gautney’s professional choices are foolish; they’re different than the ones I would make. The only reason I’m mentioning that is because she’s asked me, or people richer than me, to pay for these choices. Had she not, I’d have nothing to say about her career decisions.
The less intrusion into our private choices, the better, both for personal freedom and for creating a cohesive society that doesn’t feel it’s appropriate to cast judgment on the lifestyles other people choose to live. Feeling like we have to pay for other people’s foolish choices just breeds resentment, whether that resentment is warranted or not. So, the cost of this proposal is even higher than the already-flabbergasting $1.6 trillion.","['bailed', 'unsuspecting']"

* Some opponents vow to resist any potential vaccine

* Committed opponents see no big change in views on vaccines
By Victoria Waldersee
LISBON, April 11 (Reuters) - An American mother-of-three is a long-time member of “anti-vaxxer” groups online: a small but vocal global community that believes vaccines are a dangerous con and refuse to immunize themselves or their children.
But COVID-19 is shaking her views. The woman who would identify herself only as Stephanie, citing a fear of reprisals from committed anti-vaxxers, says she is now 50:50 on taking a vaccine should one be discovered for the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus.
“I’ve definitely thought about it,” she told Reuters by phone from the United States, also expressing frustration at what she considers the anti-vax community’s downplaying of the pandemic’s seriousness. “We’re all being affected by this virus, schools closing, young people in hospital, and they still say it’s a hoax.”
As the world’s scientists and pharmaceutical companies seek a cure for the coronavirus, other anti-vaxxers are gearing up for a fight against any potential new vaccine.
“Refuse, demonstrate,” said a Briton on Facebook in response to a post asking people how they would react if a vaccine was made mandatory.
But some virologists say the quest for a vaccine is so widely supported that resistance will be eroded.
The latest national surveys by pollster ORB International for the Vaccine Confidence Project (VCP), which monitors attitudes to immunisation, appear to support this idea.
In France, where a 2018 poll showed one in three people did not view vaccines as safe, just 18% would refuse a coronavirus vaccine now, according to the VCP poll of around 1,000 people on March 18, a day after France locked down.
In Australia, the VCP’s figure was also 7%, while Britain, where about 2,000 people were polled, and Austria registered 5% opposition in polls there a week later.
“If a vaccine were made available tomorrow, everyone would jump to get it,” said Laurent-Henri Vignaud, who co-authored a history of France’s anti-vax movement.
That view was challenged by Mary Holland, vice-chair of American non-profit group Children’s Health Defense, which is critical of vaccination in the United States.
“I don’t think this virus fundamentally changes people’s deeply held concerns about vaccines,” she told Reuters.
“I WILL NOT BE INJECTED WITH ANYTHING”
Although the term “anti-vax” is sometimes associated with conspiracy theories, many people are simply concerned about side-effects or industry ethics.
Globally, one person in five does not view vaccines as safe or is unsure, according to a 2018 survey by the Wellcome Trust health fund. reut.rs/2JTb27q
In China, where the COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus originated, surveys by VCP researchers show safety is an important cause of concern. Several scandals eroded trust, including in 2018 when a unit of China’s vaccine maker Changsheng Bio-technology Co Ltd was heavily fined for falsifying data for a rabies vaccine. The company said it was “deeply sorry” for the incident.
Online discussions tracked by Reuters - including closed Facebook pages with more than 200,000 members, Twitter feeds such as the Children’s Health Defense and YouTube videos totalling over 700,000 views - showed considerable mistrust that a rushed vaccine would be improperly tested.
VCP director Heidi Larson said that was also the main reason for concern around the vaccine against the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009.
A quickly produced swine flu vaccine in 1976 led to about one in 100,000 people developing Guillain-Barre syndrome, a paralyzing immune-system disorder, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Some 115 coronavirus vaccine candidates are being developed by institutes and drugmakers, according to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation, a global alliance financing and coordinating the development of vaccines.
“I will not be injected with anything, especially a fast-tracked vaccine,” added American Vicki Barneck, 67, who believes a strong immune system is enough to combat the disease.
Holland, of the Children’s Health Defense, said: “Some react fine to vaccines, others are paralysed or killed.”
However, a 2015 paper by CDC epidemiologists said “multiple studies and scientific reviews have found no association between vaccination and deaths except in rare cases.”
“HUNGRY FOR A VACCINE”
The VCP is running an 18-month study tracking conversation online about the coronavirus and conducting global polls to measure attitudes towards social distancing, isolation, hand-washing and anticipating a vaccine.
From analysing more than 3 million posts a day between January and mid-March 2020, director Dr Heidi Larson said the vast majority were eager for a treatment, fast.
“People are hungry for a vaccine,” she said.
In Italy, which has been hit badly by COVID-19, the anti-vax movement has “virtually disappeared” in the discussion on the coronavirus, according to virologist Dr Roberto Burioni.
For a coronavirus vaccine to be effective, wide uptake and annual vaccination is likely to be required, said George Kassianos, immunisation lead at the Royal College of General Practitioners in London.
There is also the question of how to distribute fast enough to people lining up for the vaccine.
“Essential workers will be the priority. Police officers, hospital workers, cleaners. Then at-risk groups,” said Douglas L. Hatch, a physician specialised in pandemic preparedness working on the COVID-19 response in San Francisco.

While health experts say a vaccine to prevent infection is needed to return life to normal, the survey points to a potential trust issue for the Trump administration already under fire for its often contradictory safety guidance during the pandemic.
Some 36% of respondents said they would be less willing to take a vaccine if U.S. President Donald Trump said it was safe, compared with only 14% who would be more interested.
Most respondents in the survey of 4,428 U.S. adults taken between May 13 and May 19 said they would be heavily influenced by guidance from the Food and Drug Administration or results of large-scale scientific studies showing that the vaccine was safe.
Less than two-thirds of respondents said they were “very” or “somewhat” interested in a vaccine, a figure some health experts expected would be higher given the heightened awareness of COVID-19 and the more than 92,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the United States alone.
“It’s a little lower than I thought it would be with all the attention to COVID-19,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease and vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. “I would have expected somewhere around 75 percent.”
Fourteen percent of respondents said they were not at all interested in taking a vaccine, and 10% said they were not very interested. Another 11% were unsure.
Studies are underway, but experts estimate that at least 70% of Americans would need to be immune through a vaccine or prior infection to achieve what is known as “herd immunity,” when enough people are resistant to an infectious disease to prevent its spread.
Trump has vowed to have a vaccine ready by year’s end, although they typically take 10 years or longer to develop and test for safety and effectiveness. Many experts believe a fully tested, government-approved vaccine will not be widely available until mid-2021 at the earliest.
There are more than 100 COVID-19 vaccine candidates in development globally, including some already in human clinical trials. Earlier this week, U.S. biotech Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) announced potentially promising preliminary results from just eight individuals who took part in a safety study.
Among those respondents who expressed little or no interest in a coronavirus vaccine, nearly half said they were worried about the speed with which they are being developed. More than 40% said they believe the vaccine is riskier than the disease itself.
MISINFORMATION HURDLE
Overall, 84% of respondents said vaccines for diseases such as measles are safe for both adults and children, suggesting that people hesitant to take a coronavirus vaccine might reconsider, depending on safety assurances they receive.
For example, among those who said they were “not very” interested in taking the vaccine, 29% said they would be more interested if the FDA approved it.
Some experts have said the White House’s emphasis on speed – its vaccine effort is called “Operation Warp Speed” – could leave people worried that safety was being sacrificed for swiftness.
In addition, misinformation about vaccines has grown more prevalent on social media during the pandemic, according to academic researchers.
“It’s not surprising a significant percentage of Americans are not going to take the vaccine because of the terrible messaging we’ve had, the absence of a communication plan around the vaccine and this very aggressive anti-vaccine movement,” said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, where he is developing a vaccine.
The poll underscores how the country’s deepening polarization has affected people’s view of the pandemic.
Nearly one in five Republicans say they have no interest in a vaccine, more than twice the proportion of Democrats who said the same.
Trump, a Republican, has offered mixed messages during the outbreak. He has at times downplayed the seriousness of the pandemic and encouraged public protests against his government’s own stay-at-home guidelines intended to slow the pathogen’s spread.
He has also urged Americans to try unproven treatments for COVID-19, such as the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which he said on Monday he has taken for weeks despite warnings about its use from the FDA and other health experts.
The poll responses varied among certain demographic groups. Only half of black Americans, who represent a disproportionate percentage of coronavirus deaths, said they were somewhat or very interested in a vaccine, perhaps reflecting memories of an infamous U.S. government study that left black men deliberately untreated for syphilis.
College-educated white women - a politically important demographic that has moved sharply away from the Republican Party during the Trump era - were particularly concerned about how quickly the vaccine is being developed. More than 40% said Trump’s reassurance would make them less willing to take it.

“Women’s soccer in this country has really come a long way,” said Robert Miller, 69, who was visiting New York with his adult son and who decided to watch the match on the big screen at the World Trade Center.
Miller said the team’s back-to-back World Cup title wins, completed on Sunday with a 2-0 over the Netherlands, would help propel the popularity of women’s soccer in the United States “right down to the elementary school level”.
The tournament has netted record ratings abroad and the Stars and Stripes have enjoyed surging popularity in the United States, where interest in soccer has often lagged behind American football, baseball and basketball.
“Usually when there’s a soccer game on there’s, like, a full bar, not a full restaurant,” said Stephanie Juarez, 21, a hostess at The Distillery NYC, where a standing room-only crowd was glued to the World Cup final on the gastropub’s TVs.
“It’s very interesting to me, to be honest.”
An hour before kickoff, dozens of fans lined the block in front of Smithfield Hall, a popular soccer bar in Manhattan, some claiming a spot in the queue while their friends still slept.
“I didn’t expect a long line to be here,” said Cristina Carlos, 24, donning an Alex Morgan jersey. “I am happily surprised there’s a lot of people here to watch.”

The team’s on-field prowess and off-field fight for pay equity have netted them a rabid following among some American loyals, as well as plaudits from politicians and celebrities.
Late last month, Nike’s president confirmed that the U.S. women’s national team jersey was the top-selling jersey ever sold on the Nike.com site in one season.
FIFA President Gianni Infantino said last week that he wants to expand the field of teams for the next World Cup in 2023 from 24 to 32 and double the prize money to $60 million, amid a growing outcry over pay disparity between the men’s and women’s players.",['optimistic']

The global coronavirus pandemic has infected at least 73,000 people and killed more than 1,000 in the United States as of Thursday afternoon. As U.S. authorities have told residents to remain at home and limited all but essential healthcare, the directives aimed at saving lives have hit women particularly hard, healthcare providers and patients said.
Women tend to carry more of the burden of caring for their children and elderly relatives - multiplying the strain the pandemic has put on their physical and mental health, experts said.
“We’re just hearing from a lot of women who are hitting a tipping point trying to do all of this. You just can’t get all the help that you normally would,” said Maureen Sayres Van Niel, a psychiatrist in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and president of the American Psychiatric Association’s women’s caucus.
Anxiety and depressive disorders occur twice as frequently in women as in men, said Van Niel. Public health protections such as restricting social outings, group exercise and in-person therapy sessions to keep the virus at bay are exacerbating those problems, she said.
One of her patients worries about being stuck in a stress-filled home with her abusive husband.
Other women face the anxiety of going through childbirth without their partners. In New York City, the U.S. epicenter of the pandemic, two hospital networks have implemented strict visitor policies prohibiting birthing partners.
When Dominique Claire Shuminova, 34, began having contractions on Wednesday, her husband stayed home with their 5-year-old son while she walked to a Bronx hospital nearby.
In the labor and delivery ward, Shuminova had her temperature taken and was given a COVID-19 test. She heard medical staff congratulate a woman who had just given birth alone.
“It struck me how sad and painful it is not to be able to share that moment with your partner,” said Shuminova, who nonetheless was grateful for a hospital bed and efforts to keep mothers and babies safe.
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ACCESS RESTRICTED
In Texas, hundreds of women had their appointments canceled at abortion clinics this week after the state’s attorney general said he would prosecute abortion providers under the state’s mandate to avoid all but essential medical services, said Molly Duane, a lawyer with the Center for Reproductive Rights.
Her organization and several others filed a lawsuit Wednesday night against Texas in U.S. District Court. Duane said she wrote the complaint while sequestered in her New York home with her 8-month-old baby on her lap.
Ohio, Louisiana and Mississippi are among the other states where officials have moved to block abortion access as a nonessential medical service or to free up protective equipment during the coronavirus outbreak.
Still more women have been devastated to learn their fertility treatments would be delayed under a coronavirus guideline released last week by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. The group urged doctors to suspend new fertility treatments and cancel planned embryo transfers, and promised to revisit the guidelines by March 30.
“Of course there are unhappy patients,” spokesman Sean Tipton said in an email. “There are also plenty of patients who are supportive of our recommendations. None of us are happy. Nothing about this situation is good.”
Many healthcare providers have shifted to video or telephone appointments in the age of the coronavirus.
Damara Jenkins, a registered nurse and certified nurse-midwife at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, said the OB/GYN & Women’s Health department is doing essential appointments in person and answering other questions by video or phone.
Expectant parents Chris and Katie Muscarella in Brooklyn have hired a doula whose coaching will be entirely online. Expectant mother Emily Wolfer in Ohio took a live-streamed breastfeeding course.
Van Niel, the psychiatrist, said remote sessions lack the intimacy and body language of in-person visits.
Still, they can provide some helpful relief.
Rachel Rattner, 52, who battles an autoimmune disease in Los Angeles, did a recent session with her hypnotherapist using the Zoom video app from her parked car. She said the experience was a light moment at a difficult time.
“She made me get out of the driver’s seat and sit in the passenger seat,” Rattner said. “Because she didn’t want me to one day sit in the driver’s seat and go into a trance.”",['devastated']
305, Trade jobs such as electricians or carpenters are in demand and provide steady salaries. Policymakers shouldn’t deter students who know a good job when they see it.,https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/23/americans-need-to-stop-hurrying-young-people-into-student-debt-slavery/,federalist,student-debt,right,16,2,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Above all, we must give high schoolers personalized post-secondary educational recommendations before they get caught in the quagmire of student debt.
Americans crashed the Selective Service Agency’s website in early January because of a false rumor that signing up for federal student aid through FAFSA also meant signing up for the draft. Luckily, it turns out that 18-year-olds don’t have to go to boot camp when they apply for student loans. But they could be signing up for burdensome debt.
Student debt increased by a whopping 107 percent between 2009 and 2019. Americans now owe $1.6 trillion in education loans. Policy wonks and politicians respond by concocting flashy plans that hardly solve the debt crisis.
Debt forgiveness plans like Sens. Elizabeth Warren’s and Bernie Sanders’s will encourage colleges to increase their already pricey tuitions. Proposals to restructure repayment programs or dip into retirement accounts don’t prevent students from taking out dangerous amounts of student loans in the first place. We need to help students before they’re drowning in debt.
These ideas don’t address the root problem. They assume that all 18-year-olds benefit from a college education. But this assumption is wrong. Many high schoolers don’t know what they want to do with their lives. Others enter college unprepared. Parents, teachers, and other leaders need to encourage alternative options for these students. These students are the least likely to get well-paid jobs that will allow them to repay their college loans. This will leave them in a terrible financial trap.
It’s a trap because a college education doesn’t guarantee a good job. For years, the return on investment for higher education has steadily declined. More than 40 percent of recent college graduates are underemployed and work in jobs that do not require a college education. Underemployed graduates get stuck in such positions, drastically shrinking their lifetime earnings.
Given these bleak prospects, students who go to college to “find themselves” are likely to waste precious time and money because they lack a clear vision. Thirty-three percent of students change majors and 10 percent switch majors multiple times, which prolongs the completion time and cost of a bachelor’s degree.
College also exacts a high cost from students who lack sufficient academic preparation. Between 40 and 60 percent of high school graduates are placed into remedial courses during their first year of college. Many of these students drop out and never earn bachelor’s degrees. College drop-outs earn far less on average and are almost four times more likely to default on student loans than college graduates. Defaulters destroy their credit scores and damage their borrowing ability for a house or a car.
Parents, teachers, and other leaders should carefully note these trends and consider tailoring their career advice to each student’s specific needs. Most American policymakers say all students should attend college, but that’s a bad recommendation for unsure and unprepared students. Alternative paths to success exist.
Students without direction should first discover their strengths and interests through internships, apprenticeships, volunteer positions, or directly entering the workforce. Ideally, they should earn money while they “find themselves,” not borrow money in pursuit of a college degree that may not benefit them. These students would profit from putting off college until they know how they want to use the education.
Some high school students know they aren’t interested in college. Policymakers should support these students by encouraging them to attend a vocational school or enter the workforce. Trade jobs such as electricians or carpenters are in demand and provide steady salaries. Policymakers shouldn’t deter students who know a good job when they see it.
Some students want jobs that require a college degree, but aren’t prepared for the work. The worst choice they could make would be to spend or borrow money to attend college when they aren’t ready. These students should delay college enrollment until they are academically prepared. Students can study online, read books in public libraries, take remedial courses at community colleges—and, most importantly, work and earn money while they prepare.
Americans should, however, recommend students to attend college if they are ready and have a clear understanding of what they want to do with their education. Many lucrative careers require at least a bachelor’s degree, and these students should pursue college as soon as possible. But it’s not a good investment to encourage unprepared students to drift into debt slavery.
Policies that tighten loan eligibility requirements for college-bound students will discourage unprepared students from drifting into college. For example, federal student loan programs should be reformed to restrict eligibility to applicants with above-average high school GPAs and family incomes below 150 percent of the poverty level.
Above all, we must give high schoolers personalized post-secondary educational recommendations before they get caught in the quagmire of student debt. If we don’t, a whole generation of Americans will be sucked under.",['deter']
308,"Biden, who served eight years as vice president under Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, cast himself as the candidate who best understands the longstanding pain and grief in the country’s black communities.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden/biden-vows-to-heal-racial-wounds-rips-trump-as-divisive-is-this-who-we-want-to-be-idUSKBN2391ZB,reuters,elections-2020,center,16,1,Non-biased,No agreement,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Tuesday blasted President Donald Trump’s response to U.S. protests over racism and police misconduct, vowing to try to heal the country’s racial divide and not “fan the flames of hate.”
Speaking in Philadelphia – a city rocked by sometimes violent demonstrations in recent days – the former vice president sought to draw a vivid contrast between himself and Trump, whom he will face in the Nov. 3 general election.
Biden, who served eight years as vice president under Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, cast himself as the candidate who best understands the longstanding pain and grief in the country’s black communities.
He said the killing of George Floyd, the African-American man who died at the hands of Minneapolis police last week, was a “wake-up call” for the nation that must force it to address the stain of systemic racism.
“We can’t leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away and do nothing,” Biden said. “We can’t.”
He accused Trump, a Republican, of turning the nation into “a battlefield riven by old resentments and fresh fears.”
“Is this who we want to be?” he asked. “Is this what we want to pass on to our children and grandchildren? Fear, anger, finger pointing, rather than the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety, self-absorption, selfishness?”
Biden was particularly critical of Trump’s visit on Monday to a historic church across from the White House, which was preceded by law enforcement authorities dispersing a crowd near the church with smoke canisters and flash grenades.
“We can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,” said Biden, who accused Trump of “serving the passions” of his conservative base at the expense of the rest of the country.

Biden pledged he would “not traffic in fear or division.”
Biden, 77, has been under pressure from young African-Americans and other progressives to aggressively address racial and economic inequities in the country - and he has been increasingly talking in terms of sweeping societal change.
His long history in the Senate, where he authored a now-heavily criticized crime bill in the 1990s, has at times complicated that effort, sowing some mistrust among activists.
At the same time, he has been mindful of condemning the looting and violence that has marked some of the protests.
Trump campaign senior adviser Katrina Pierson accused Biden in a statement after the speech of making “the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.”
Trump on Monday called the violence at the protests “acts of domestic terror” and threatened to deploy the U.S. military to secure the nation’s cities.
Biden’s speech on Tuesday at Philadelphia’s City Hall marked the first time he has left his home state of Delaware since mid-March, when the outbreak of the novel coronavirus forced him to halt in-person campaigning.
While Biden had made public appearances in Delaware in recent days and convened a virtual conference of big-city mayors on Monday, Tuesday’s speech suggested he may soon begin to again move about the country as states slowly re-open.
Biden formally launched his White House bid in Philadelphia last year, and it’s where his campaign headquarters - currently empty because of the pandemic - is located.

The city was also the birthplace of the U.S. Constitution, which Biden cited in his speech as support of the right to peacefully protest.

Europe has become the new epicentre of the flu-like virus that originated in China late last year and restrictions on movement in several nations have hit the training plans of athletes ahead of the July 24 to Aug. 9 Tokyo Games.
""Recent evidence suggests China seems to be pulling out of this but if you're living in Europe, you're an Italian distance runner and you're confined to your house, that's a massive challenge,"" Coe told The Times newspaper in an interview here
“Our sport has always been about fairness and a level playing field so we shouldn’t feel ashamed to set that as our ambition. The reality is that may not be possible in every case but we want to do what we can to drill down on that.
“Some are not able to train properly, some are not able to access public tracks or indoor facilities and we’re working to try and help them find these facilities.”
The virus has infected more than 212,000 people globally and caused 8,700 deaths so far, sparking concerns over the viability of the Games.
Coe, the driving force behind the success of London 2012 as chairman of the organising committee, said the problem faced by the Tokyo Games was bigger than the mass boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics.
“I lived through Moscow and that was a crisis ... This has probably exercised more thinking time and expended more effort for federations than anything I can remember,” Coe added.
“We’re doing everything we possibly can to get our sport and our athletes into the best possible shape through a challenging time and get to an Olympic Games.” (Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford )",[]

Some 378,000 eligible U.S. voters who are trans do not have identification such as a driver’s license that reflects their appearance or gender identity, said a report by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, a public policy research institute.
In the United States, 35 of the 50 states require voters to show identification and of the trans people without IDs, 260,000 live in one of the 35 states, the research said.
Backers of voter ID laws say they are intended to combat voter fraud.
Voter rights advocates say the number of actual cases is extremely small and restrictions disproportionately affect poor and minority voters.
In the November 2020 election, Democrats are hoping to oust U.S. President Donald Trump, the presumed Republican nominee, from a second term in the White House.
On Election Day, poll officials and workers decide whether the voter in front of them is the person on the voter registration rolls, said report co-author Jody Herman, a researcher at Williams, in a statement.
“Especially in states that require an ID to be shown, this could result in some transgender voters being disenfranchised,” she said.
Keeping trans people from voting could favor the Republican party that is more conservative than its Democratic rival, said Richard Hasen, an election law expert and law professor at the University of California, Irvine.
“If you look at the demographics of people least likely to have an ID, they tend to be more poor or a racial or ethnic minority,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
“These all correlate with someone who is more likely to vote for a Democrat.”
In 2018, civil rights groups in Georgia accused a top state official, a Republican, of trying to depress minority turnout, by putting more than 50,000 voter registration applications on hold, to improve his chances in his bid to become governor.
The state of Georgia has an “exact match” law requiring personal information on voter applications such as names to match state databases.
Having an ID that does not reflect an individual’s gender identity can make it difficult for transgender people to apply for jobs, get housing or travel, advocates say.
“Transgender people should not be denied their opportunity to participate in our democracy because laws and regulations around identification documents haven’t kept up with reality,” said Mara Keisling, head of The National Center for Transgender Equality Action Fund, in a statement.
“Every eligible US citizen should be allowed to vote, including members of the transgender community.”
Advocates have argued for ways to change gender markers on birth certificates and other documents, a process that varies state by state.
Earlier this week, a U.S. lawmaker on Tuesday introduced a bill that would add a gender-neutral option to passports to advance the rights of LGBT+ people.
Several U.S. states where voter ID is required, including Alabama, Tennessee and Virginia, will hold primaries next Tuesday.
Dubbed Super Tuesday, the 14-state March 3 contest offers the largest single-day haul of delegates in the Democratic Party’s White House nominating battle.

319,The Border Patrol has said Hernandez was pelting U.S. agents with rocks from the Mexican side of the Rio Grande when he was shot.,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-border/supreme-court-bars-lawsuit-over-cross-border-shooting-of-mexican-teen-idUSKBN20J1ZS?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews,reuters,immigration,center,16,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday barred a lawsuit against a Border Patrol agent for fatally shooting a 15-year-old Mexican boy on Mexican soil from across the border in Texas, refusing to open the door for foreign nationals to pursue civil rights cases in American courts in such incidents.
With its conservative justices in the majority and its liberal justices dissenting, the court voted 5-4 to uphold a lower court’s dismissal of the lawsuit against the agent, Jesus Mesa, who was standing on the U.S. side of the border when he shot Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca in the face in 2010.
The boy’s family sued in federal court seeking monetary damages, accusing Mesa of violating the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment ban on unjustified deadly force and the Fifth Amendment right to due process.
The ruling, which matched the position taken by President Donald Trump’s administration in the case, also ended litigation involving a similar incident in which a Border Patrol agent fatally shot a 16-year-old Mexican named Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez from across the border in Arizona.
“To be left with no remedy ... given such a violent and unprovoked shooting weakens the constitutional foundation of America’s house,” said Robert Hilliard, a lawyer for Hernandez’s family, adding that the ruling could “promote a Wild West attitude on our border.”

The decision prevents civil rights lawsuits in U.S. federal courts involving such cross-border incidents when the person who is injured or killed is not on American soil.
Later on Tuesday, the Mexican government said it is deeply concerned about the effects this decision will have on similar cases in which its citizens have died from gunshots fired by U.S. agents towards the Mexican side.
“The gravity of this ruling could not be clearer given the Trump administration’s militarized rhetoric and policies targeting people at the border,” said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents the Rodriguez family.
The ruling was issued at a time of high tensions involving the southern border, where Trump is pursuing construction of a wall separating the United States and Mexico.
Justice Samuel Alito, writing for majority, said the case presented “foreign relations and national security implications” and noted that Congress should decide whether such lawsuits can be permitted.

Alito added that the United States and Mexico have sought to resolve border issues through diplomacy and that U.S. Border Patrol agents have a key role in protecting national security, including illegal cross-border traffic.
‘SCARCELY MAKES SENSE’
The incident took place on the border between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez in Mexico. Hernandez was in a culvert located right on the border, just on the Mexican side.
In a dissenting opinion on behalf of the court’s liberals, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dismissed the national security concerns cited by the conservative majority.
“Mesa’s allegedly unwarranted deployment of deadly force occurred on United States soil. It scarcely makes sense for a remedy trained on deterring rogue officer conduct to turn upon a happenstance subsequent to the conduct - a bullet landing in one half of a culvert, not the other,” Ginsburg wrote.
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency had no immediate comment. A lawyer for Mesa could not immediately be reached for comment.

Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate opinion, joined by fellow conservative Neil Gorsuch, agreeing with the outcome but calling for the court to throw out a broader precedent from 1971 that allows people to sue federal officials individually for civil rights violations.
The Supreme Court has been reluctant to extend the scope of civil rights protections. For example, it ruled in 2017 that U.S. officials who served under former President George W. Bush could not be sued over the treatment of non-U.S. citizen detainees rounded up in New York after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.
Mesa did not face criminal charges, though Mexico condemned the shooting. The Border Patrol has said Hernandez was pelting U.S. agents with rocks from the Mexican side of the Rio Grande when he was shot. The FBI also said Hernandez was an immigrant smuggler, guiding illegal immigrants into the United States.
The lawyers for Hernandez’s family disputed that account, saying he was playing a game in which a group of teenagers would run across the culvert from the Mexican side and touch the U.S. border fence before running back.",[]

WADA wants to investigate all the athletes who trained with banned coach Alberto Salazar at the Nike Oregon Project, one of which was Britain’s Farah, the 5,000m and 10,000m champion at both the London 2012 and Rio de Janeiro 2016 Games.
“UKAD has not refused any request from WADA. To clarify, at this moment in time we have not received any request from WADA for reanalysis of samples we hold for any sportsperson,” the UKAD said in a statement.
“On the specific subject of the Nike Oregon Project, in Nov. 2019 we proactively offered to assist WADA in their endeavors and to date we have received no such request for any assistance.
“We have been clear that we are happy to assist any anti-doping organization including WADA.”

Salazar was given a four-year ban in September by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), which said he was guilty of “orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct” as head coach of the Oregon Project.

Officials in the two states, which already have severe restrictions on abortions, said postponing elective procedures would allow beds and staff to be focused on coronavirus cases.
Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the nation’s coronavirus task force, asked the nation’s hospitals last week to cease elective surgeries to free up capacity and staff, amid dire shortages of masks and gloves.
Texas officials said the measure would apply to abortions that were not necessary to save the mother’s life or health.
“No one is exempt from the governor’s executive order on medically unnecessary surgeries and procedures, including abortion providers,” said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in a statement.
Ohio’s Attorney General told facilities to stop performing abortions that require personal protective equipment, such as gowns and masks, according to documents obtained by local media.
The United States has reported some 50,000 coronavirus cases, including almost 600 deaths, leading officials to order nearly a third of the population to stay home.
Abortion remains one of the most divisive issues in American society, with the Supreme Court due to rule in June on a major case which challenges a Louisiana law that could make it harder for women to obtain the procedure.
The anti-abortion group Americans United for Life (AUL) told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in emailed comments on Tuesday that Ohio and Texas were “doing the right thing”.
“The sheer selfishness on display by abortionists refusing to close shop even for a brief time to funnel every possible resource to the brave medical providers ... is simply unconscionable,” said AUL’s head Catherine Glenn Foster.
Several professional obstetric and gynecological groups have said delays to abortions could be risky.

While health experts say a vaccine to prevent infection is needed to return life to normal, the survey points to a potential trust issue for the Trump administration already under fire for its often contradictory safety guidance during the pandemic.
Some 36% of respondents said they would be less willing to take a vaccine if U.S. President Donald Trump said it was safe, compared with only 14% who would be more interested.
Most respondents in the survey of 4,428 U.S. adults taken between May 13 and May 19 said they would be heavily influenced by guidance from the Food and Drug Administration or results of large-scale scientific studies showing that the vaccine was safe.
Less than two-thirds of respondents said they were “very” or “somewhat” interested in a vaccine, a figure some health experts expected would be higher given the heightened awareness of COVID-19 and the more than 92,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the United States alone.
“It’s a little lower than I thought it would be with all the attention to COVID-19,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease and vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. “I would have expected somewhere around 75 percent.”
Fourteen percent of respondents said they were not at all interested in taking a vaccine, and 10% said they were not very interested. Another 11% were unsure.
Studies are underway, but experts estimate that at least 70% of Americans would need to be immune through a vaccine or prior infection to achieve what is known as “herd immunity,” when enough people are resistant to an infectious disease to prevent its spread.
Trump has vowed to have a vaccine ready by year’s end, although they typically take 10 years or longer to develop and test for safety and effectiveness. Many experts believe a fully tested, government-approved vaccine will not be widely available until mid-2021 at the earliest.
There are more than 100 COVID-19 vaccine candidates in development globally, including some already in human clinical trials. Earlier this week, U.S. biotech Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) announced potentially promising preliminary results from just eight individuals who took part in a safety study.
Among those respondents who expressed little or no interest in a coronavirus vaccine, nearly half said they were worried about the speed with which they are being developed. More than 40% said they believe the vaccine is riskier than the disease itself.
MISINFORMATION HURDLE
Overall, 84% of respondents said vaccines for diseases such as measles are safe for both adults and children, suggesting that people hesitant to take a coronavirus vaccine might reconsider, depending on safety assurances they receive.
For example, among those who said they were “not very” interested in taking the vaccine, 29% said they would be more interested if the FDA approved it.
Some experts have said the White House’s emphasis on speed – its vaccine effort is called “Operation Warp Speed” – could leave people worried that safety was being sacrificed for swiftness.
In addition, misinformation about vaccines has grown more prevalent on social media during the pandemic, according to academic researchers.
“It’s not surprising a significant percentage of Americans are not going to take the vaccine because of the terrible messaging we’ve had, the absence of a communication plan around the vaccine and this very aggressive anti-vaccine movement,” said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, where he is developing a vaccine.
The poll underscores how the country’s deepening polarization has affected people’s view of the pandemic.
Nearly one in five Republicans say they have no interest in a vaccine, more than twice the proportion of Democrats who said the same.
Trump, a Republican, has offered mixed messages during the outbreak. He has at times downplayed the seriousness of the pandemic and encouraged public protests against his government’s own stay-at-home guidelines intended to slow the pathogen’s spread.
He has also urged Americans to try unproven treatments for COVID-19, such as the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which he said on Monday he has taken for weeks despite warnings about its use from the FDA and other health experts.
The poll responses varied among certain demographic groups. Only half of black Americans, who represent a disproportionate percentage of coronavirus deaths, said they were somewhat or very interested in a vaccine, perhaps reflecting memories of an infamous U.S. government study that left black men deliberately untreated for syphilis.
College-educated white women - a politically important demographic that has moved sharply away from the Republican Party during the Trump era - were particularly concerned about how quickly the vaccine is being developed. More than 40% said Trump’s reassurance would make them less willing to take it.

Only 46% of Americans who identify as Republicans say the country is on the right track, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted last week. It is the first time that number has fallen so low since August 2017, when a rally organized by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia led to violent clashes with counter-protesters.
As recently as early March, before the novel coronavirus forced widespread shutdowns across the country, about 70% of Republicans said they were optimistic about the country’s direction.
Trump’s approval rating remains resilient at around 40%, with a large majority of Republicans still approving of his overall performance.
But sustained pessimism among Trump’s supporters could portend potential weakness ahead of November’s election, when he will face Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden, experts said.
Thirty-seven percent of Republicans said the country is on the wrong track; 17% of those said they would vote for Biden if the election were held now, while 63% still plan to cast ballots for Trump.
In an election most analysts believe will come down to a handful of closely divided states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, even minor defections or a dip in turnout among the Republican ranks could imperil Trump’s chances.
“It probably should be concerning for the president, even though it’s reasonable to say he still maintains strong support among Republicans,” said Kyle Kondik, an elections analyst at the University of Virginia.
Republicans believe an economic rebound in the fall would bolster his prospects. Friday’s jobs report showed more than 2.5 million jobs were added last month during the thick of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump touted the gains as the “greatest comeback in American history.”
Trump campaign spokeswoman Erin Perrine said in a statement, “Polling is notoriously wrong. We are five months from the election and any polling now is not a clear indicator of election results. Pollsters were very wrong in 2016 and underestimate voters’ enthusiasm for President Trump every time.”
‘THINGS ARE DEFINITELY WRONG’
The pessimism among all Americans has grown since the end of February, when the pandemic began accelerating. But unlike Republicans, large majorities of Democrats and independents already felt the country was on the wrong track; fewer than 7 percent of Democrats and 19 percent of independents feel the country is headed in the right direction, down slightly from March, the poll showed.
Matthew Knight, a 48-year-old resident in North Carolina who supported Trump in 2016, said he has been disappointed with Trump’s response to the crises.
“Just think with everything going on, and Trump not helping matters, that things are definitely wrong,” Knight wrote in an email to Reuters. “I was going to vote for Trump, but if things don’t get better, I may have to rethink that.”
Reuters conducted interviews and email exchanges with more than a dozen Republicans who said the country was headed in the wrong direction, yielding a mix of responses.
Some, such as Bill McMichael, a 62-year-old in politically divided Minnesota who hasn’t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in four decades, are considering voting for Biden out of disgust with Trump.
A few admitted some misgivings but still plan to vote for Trump, either because they are more skeptical about Biden or trust Trump to revive the economy. Others blamed Democrats for the country’s problems.
“The last week sure shows you the direction the liberals are trying to drive this country,” said Ken Wilamowski, 68, a retired General Motors engineer in Clarkston, Michigan, adding that Democratic governors have been too unwilling to confront protesters. “Pacifism is going to lose to anarchy every time.”
Trump has urged governors to “dominate” the streets and claimed that far-left radicals are primarily responsible for the violence. Protesters again gathered in Washington for a big demonstration on Saturday.
“In normal political circumstances, having a 40% favorability would be terrible, but that’s just not the world we live in right now,” said Terry Sullivan, a Republican strategist who served as Senator Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign manager in 2016. “The numbers really haven’t moved in the last 3-1/2 years.”
Tom Singer, a 57-year-old probation officer in Riverside, California, said Trump’s presidency has been “dysfunctional.” Nevertheless, he said he would still likely vote for him in November because he trusts Trump will deliver where it matters most: on the economy.
“I’m not happy with either candidate, but I have to look at the one who’s going to have the greatest impact on me,” he said.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States and gathered responses from 1,113 American adults. It had a credibility interval of plus or minus 3 percentage points.","['pessimistic', 'buffets', 'trio', 'of', 'crises']"

And he’s not content to allow time to take its uncertain political toll. ",https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2015/07/31/mark-levins-plunder-and-deceit-takes-fight-to-millenial-generation/,breitbart,student-debt,right,19,1,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"In Liberty and Tyranny, iconic syndicated radio host Mark Levin laid out the stakes of the conflict between Constitutional Americanism and the forces of the statists—those who would see governmental power maximized in order to achieve the chimerical equality sought by the American left. In Ameritopia, he exposed the utopianism underlying the tyranny of the left, a utopianism with roots running back centuries. In The Liberty Amendments, Levin proposed constitutional amendments designed to rollback the perversions of the Constitution foisted upon Americans by those utopian statists.
Now, in his elegant and moving new book, Plunder and Deceit, Levin takes his message to the next generation. While conservatives may find comfort in the old saw that those who aren’t liberal at 20 have no heart, and those who aren’t conservative at 40 have no brain, the truth, as Levin knows, is that those who are statists at 20 usually end up statists at 40. And he’s not content to allow time to take its uncertain political toll. He wants young Americans to know the threats to their future, and he wants them to know those threats now—and he wants their parents to see the errors of their ways before it’s too late.
Levin’s Plunder and Deceit opens with a question not for young Americans but for their parents: “Can we simultaneously love our children but betray their generation and generations yet born?” he asks. The answer, Levin says, is no. We can pretend to ourselves that politics have no importance to the lives of our children, even as we engage as good parents. But that isn’t love, it’s moral cowardice:
To embrace the moral order as parents nurturing their children, yet to abandon the moral order as members of the ruling generation, thereby contributing to predictably deleterious public policies with prospectively calamitous outcomes, is a decadence that leads to unstable and potentially oppressive or even tyrannical contradictions which, in the end, degrade and disassemble the civil society and consume their children’s generation and generations beyond.
Meanwhile, young people are being seduced by utopian idealism at the expense of eternal values:
By cultivating agitation and balkanization almost nothing about the civil society is said to be true, right, or lasting and, therefore, worth preserving and perpetuating. Instead, much uproar is generated in the quest for utopian abstractions and societal transformation – the fundamental cause around which younger people have been encouraged and trained to rally, to their detriment and the jeopardy of subsequent generations, and to the benefit of the statist.
How do we counter the dual trends of parental abdication and youthful utopianism? Levin suggests truth as the weapon and then, armed with truth, resistance.
Levin begins his tome by writing about the crushing debt burden that young people will carry all of their lives thanks to the profligacy of their parents. That debt will take its toll in the form of rising interest rates, less investment, and a dramatically slowing economy. Debt, Levin writes, is a moral problem, not merely an economic one: “Stealing from the future does not establish the utopia promised by the statists. It is the rising generation’s grave moral failure.”
Levin extends that sort of clarity to his examinations of Social Security (“economically and fiscally irrational and irresponsible,” a program destined to take down “the older recipients and the younger payers alike”); Medicare and Obamacare (“simultaneously expanding and imploding”); modern American education (“administrators and educational bureaucrats, labor unions, tenured educators, improvident construction projects, and statist indoctrination”); immigration (“immigration without assimilation and Americanization undercuts the civil society as ethnic, racial and religious groups self-segregate”); climate change (“hysterical doomsday predictions of environmental Armageddon, which can only be avoided by the imposition of [environmentalists’] severe, ideologically driven agenda”); minimum wage (“the consequences… include pervasive unemployment and the lack of important job experience”); national security (“too many younger people are inattentive to or nonplussed about – or in rancorous opposition to – the development and maintenance” of strong national defense).
Finally, Levin comes to the Constitution. The bedrock document upon which the nation was founded has taken a heavy beating from President Obama and statists for decades; Levin looks to it as a guidebook from our current predicament rather than a beloved relic to be worshipped as a museum piece. The Constitution, Levin writes, “provides the governing order of a republic intended to protect the individual’s liberty from a tyrannical centralized authority and, conversely, the anarchy of mob rule.” But the document requires an informed citizenry to utilize it: “The citizenry must be alert and resolute and ensure that those who hold high office uphold the rules of governance.”
The people, however, have failed in their duty to uphold the Constitution, Levin says. Levin poses the battle as one between defenders of the Constitutional republic and statists informed by the spirit of Marx. And the Marxists are winning, gradually reducing the American people to a state of soul-sucking apathy and servitude.
Levin, rightly, blames Congress, which was supposed to be the lawmaking branch. His stunning comparison between the number of pages of federal regulations for 2014 (79,066) and number of actual regulations (3,541) versus the number of laws passed by Congress (129) demonstrates the increased power of the executive branch at the expense of the legislature. The statist vision is coming to pass in real time. And if the members of the younger generation continue to allow statists to plunder and deceive them, “they will commit future generations to an even more miserable plight.”
Levin responds to that threat by calling for a “new civil rights movement,” focused on the complete overhaul of education, immigration policy, Medicare and Obamacare, and all the rest. The new civil rights movement, says Levin, must “speak out, challenge, debate, rally, and protest. It must become a force for respectful and prudential activism. And when circumstances are unjust or oppressive, it must even disobey – but in a civil and peaceful way, unlike the violent and destructive rage of the 1960s radical underground movement and its modern adherents.”
“The right cause,” Levin concludes, “now is nothing short of self-preservation.” This is a battle for our lies and the lives of our children. It’s time to engage.

(Reuters) - The man behind a petition drive to recall a California state senator and physician pushing for tougher vaccine requirements was charged on Wednesday with assault after livestreaming himself shoving the lawmaker in a sidewalk confrontation in Sacramento.
Kenneth Austin Bennett, 54, known for presenting his anti-vaccine views and various conspiracy theories on social media, posted self-recorded video on his own Facebook page showing him accosting Senator Richard Pan during what appears as a chance encounter on the street.
Bennett is seen immediately unleashing a tirade against Pan as he walks beside the politician, who tries to ignore, then laugh off his antagonist. Bennett then thrusts his hand into the lawmaker’s back and pushes him sharply from behind, sending Pan stumbling forward.
The lawmaker whips around to briefly face Bennett, pointing his fingers at him, shouting “Hey, hey,” then turns back around abruptly and walks away as he and a companion take out their cell phones, presumably to report the incident.
Pan, a Sacramento Democrat and medical doctor, is then seen ducking into a nearby restaurant. Bennett continues the livestream, filming himself as he acknowledges out loud, “I probably shouldn’t have done that.”
He goes on to accuse Pan of “poisoning our children,” adding, “If he got what he deserved, he would be hanged for treason, for assaulting children, for misrepresenting the truth.”
Bennett mounted an unsuccessful primary election challenge to Pan in 2018 and failed to qualify for the general election. In May, he launched a recall campaign against Pan, filing a petition accusing him of “high treason” for authoring legislation to restrict vaccine exemptions for school children.
Sacramento police called to investigate Wednesday’s confrontation, which occurred blocks away from the state Capitol, cited Bennett with misdemeanor assault, and he was released, police spokesman Marcus Basquez said.
Pan was not hurt, Basquez said.
State Senate President pro Tempore Toni Atkins later decried the incident in a statement saying fellow legislators would assist in investigating the matter.
“There is absolutely no reason for resorting to violence,” she said. “This is a place where laws are meant to be made, not broken.”
Pan’s spokeswoman, Shannan Velayas, was quoted by the Los Angeles Times as saying her boss has routinely been targeted by anti-vaccine activists since he introduced a bill in 2015 creating strict vaccine requirements for school children.
She said his more recent bill to further tighten vaccine laws has prompted a new round of threats.

Strava, which tracks the sports activity trends of some 50 million people in almost 200 countries, surveyed 25,000 runners and found that half of them say they either hate it or barely tolerate it, while only 8% love it.
But running is often “connected with a sense of stability at a deeper level,” Strava said in a report of the survey’s findings. “Runners described the need to run to maintain their sense of self and as a way to respond to adversity.”
“There’s a great realisation that to exercise the body also helps to exercise the mind - which is a muscle that needs just as much looking after as the other muscles,” said Simon Klima, Strava’s global marketing director.
And love it or hate it, the vast majority of runners cited health as a primary motivator for getting out and clocking up the miles. More than 80% said they started running to get healthier, stronger or have more energy.
In Brazil, 22% of amateur runners said they’d taken up the sport due to a health scare. That compares with just 2% in the United States. There, almost half of respondents said building strength was a core motivator to run - and this was even higher - at 54% - among U.S. women.
German runners were the most likely of the nations surveyed to cite body image as a reason to run - at 47% - and in Japan, 15% say they run to combat feelings of anxiety and depression.
Klima sees this as a sign of the times: “With social media networks putting pressure on people for how they look, it’s driving up the motivating factor of body image,” he said.
The “Why We Run” survey - which included respondents from nine countries in North America, South America, Asia and Europe - showed how runners worldwide share many common traits.
It clustered runners into five key types based on the benefits they value and the extent to which they race or run in social groups.
They ranged from “passionate runners”, who run in many social settings and reap the psychosocial benefits like accomplishment and happiness, to “mindful runners” - who tend to run alone - to “reluctant runners” who rarely compete in races and perceive the fewest social or psychological benefits of all runner types.","['hate', 'barely', 'tolerate']"

Attorney General Letitia James said the accord permanently bans Debt Resolve Inc, Progress Advocates LLC, Student Loan Care LLC and two of the companies’ executives, Bruce Bellmare and Stanley Freimuth, from the debt relief industry.
James said the companies also agreed to excuse outstanding consumer loans and accept a $5.5 million court judgment, but will pay just $250,000 to satisfy it because they are in bankruptcy and have a limited ability to pay.
The defendants did not admit or deny wrongdoing. Their lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The settlement requires court approval.
In the lawsuit, James accused 13 defendants of fraud and violating consumer protection laws, through such practices as promising loan forgiveness they could not deliver, and charging illegal upfront fees and excessive interest rates.
The lawsuit began in September 2018 under James’ predecessor Barbara Underwood. Twelve defendants have settled, resulting in $525,000 in restitution to consumers and more than $4 million in loan forbearance. The 13th defendant defaulted.

* Some opponents vow to resist any potential vaccine
* But scale of crisis erodes resistance of others

* Committed opponents see no big change in views on vaccines
By Victoria Waldersee
LISBON, April 11 (Reuters) - An American mother-of-three is a long-time member of “anti-vaxxer” groups online: a small but vocal global community that believes vaccines are a dangerous con and refuse to immunize themselves or their children.
But COVID-19 is shaking her views. The woman who would identify herself only as Stephanie, citing a fear of reprisals from committed anti-vaxxers, says she is now 50:50 on taking a vaccine should one be discovered for the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus.
“I’ve definitely thought about it,” she told Reuters by phone from the United States, also expressing frustration at what she considers the anti-vax community’s downplaying of the pandemic’s seriousness. “We’re all being affected by this virus, schools closing, young people in hospital, and they still say it’s a hoax.”
As the world’s scientists and pharmaceutical companies seek a cure for the coronavirus, other anti-vaxxers are gearing up for a fight against any potential new vaccine.
“Refuse, demonstrate,” said a Briton on Facebook in response to a post asking people how they would react if a vaccine was made mandatory.
But some virologists say the quest for a vaccine is so widely supported that resistance will be eroded.
The latest national surveys by pollster ORB International for the Vaccine Confidence Project (VCP), which monitors attitudes to immunisation, appear to support this idea.
In France, where a 2018 poll showed one in three people did not view vaccines as safe, just 18% would refuse a coronavirus vaccine now, according to the VCP poll of around 1,000 people on March 18, a day after France locked down.
In Australia, the VCP’s figure was also 7%, while Britain, where about 2,000 people were polled, and Austria registered 5% opposition in polls there a week later.
“If a vaccine were made available tomorrow, everyone would jump to get it,” said Laurent-Henri Vignaud, who co-authored a history of France’s anti-vax movement.
That view was challenged by Mary Holland, vice-chair of American non-profit group Children’s Health Defense, which is critical of vaccination in the United States.
“I don’t think this virus fundamentally changes people’s deeply held concerns about vaccines,” she told Reuters.
“I WILL NOT BE INJECTED WITH ANYTHING”
Although the term “anti-vax” is sometimes associated with conspiracy theories, many people are simply concerned about side-effects or industry ethics.
Globally, one person in five does not view vaccines as safe or is unsure, according to a 2018 survey by the Wellcome Trust health fund. reut.rs/2JTb27q
In China, where the COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus originated, surveys by VCP researchers show safety is an important cause of concern. Several scandals eroded trust, including in 2018 when a unit of China’s vaccine maker Changsheng Bio-technology Co Ltd was heavily fined for falsifying data for a rabies vaccine. The company said it was “deeply sorry” for the incident.
Online discussions tracked by Reuters - including closed Facebook pages with more than 200,000 members, Twitter feeds such as the Children’s Health Defense and YouTube videos totalling over 700,000 views - showed considerable mistrust that a rushed vaccine would be improperly tested.
VCP director Heidi Larson said that was also the main reason for concern around the vaccine against the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009.
A quickly produced swine flu vaccine in 1976 led to about one in 100,000 people developing Guillain-Barre syndrome, a paralyzing immune-system disorder, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Some 115 coronavirus vaccine candidates are being developed by institutes and drugmakers, according to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation, a global alliance financing and coordinating the development of vaccines.
“I will not be injected with anything, especially a fast-tracked vaccine,” added American Vicki Barneck, 67, who believes a strong immune system is enough to combat the disease.
Holland, of the Children’s Health Defense, said: “Some react fine to vaccines, others are paralysed or killed.”
However, a 2015 paper by CDC epidemiologists said “multiple studies and scientific reviews have found no association between vaccination and deaths except in rare cases.”
“HUNGRY FOR A VACCINE”
The VCP is running an 18-month study tracking conversation online about the coronavirus and conducting global polls to measure attitudes towards social distancing, isolation, hand-washing and anticipating a vaccine.
From analysing more than 3 million posts a day between January and mid-March 2020, director Dr Heidi Larson said the vast majority were eager for a treatment, fast.
“People are hungry for a vaccine,” she said.
In Italy, which has been hit badly by COVID-19, the anti-vax movement has “virtually disappeared” in the discussion on the coronavirus, according to virologist Dr Roberto Burioni.
For a coronavirus vaccine to be effective, wide uptake and annual vaccination is likely to be required, said George Kassianos, immunisation lead at the Royal College of General Practitioners in London.
There is also the question of how to distribute fast enough to people lining up for the vaccine.
“Essential workers will be the priority. Police officers, hospital workers, cleaners. Then at-risk groups,” said Douglas L. Hatch, a physician specialised in pandemic preparedness working on the COVID-19 response in San Francisco.

The professor, author of The Ahuman Manifesto: Activism for the End of the Anthropocene who describes herself as an “old school goth,” says that the only way to save the planet is to stop having children and allow humans to become extinct.
According to the official description of the book, MacCormack “actively embraces issues like human extinction, vegan abolition, atheist occultism, death studies, a refusal of identity politics, deep ecology, and the apocalypse as an optimistic beginning.”
Due to global overpopulation, giving birth is the worst thing you can do to the planet, MacCormack sustains, while insisting that she is not advocating wiping out the existing population but rather letting it die off.
“Far from advocating mass death, genocide or eugenics, my manifesto is antinatalist,” says MacCormack. “It boycotts human reproduction due to the damage humans have perpetrated on the Earth and its other inhabitants.”
“The manifesto simply asks that humans no longer reproduce – no life is lost, no being is mourned,” she states. “If we no longer reproduce, we can care for all inhabitants already here, human and non-human, as well as care for the Earth itself by mitigating the damage already caused. It’s an activism of care.”
A native Australian, MacCormack says her opinions have been manipulated and misunderstood.
“I simply propose people not reproduce, and it automatically translated into acts of violence,” she has said.
“So, somehow, I want to kill children, which is ridiculous. Somehow, I’m proposing eugenics or some kind of ethnic population control,” she declares, “and I think that what that shows is there is an anthropocentric — or a human — impulse to read acts of grace as, automatically, acts of violence.”
“And that says a lot more about the people not reading the book and just taking over the message,” she states.
MacCormack, who moonlights as a London DJ, said that her position can be “triggering” because it forces people to confront an idea that contradicts their fundamental view of the world.
Along with her opinions regarding the human population, MacCormack advocates overcoming “human privilege” through what she calls “abolitionist veganism,” or the notion that no sentient being should be treated as property of another.
According to MacCormack, her manifesto “questions the value of human exceptionalism, asking are humans really the ‘best’ forms of life, or should we dismantle our understanding of life as a hierarchy for a more ecological, interconnected scheme of living things?”
“There are people living in the apocalypse right now — especially non-human animals — who have born into an apocalypse. They live to suffer and then they’re murdered,” she said.
Among other climate action groups, MacCormack says that those like the protest group Extinction Rebellion have the right idea but are not going far enough.
“Even Extinction Rebellion only focus on the effect this will have on human life, when climate change is something that will affect every living being on the planet,” she states.
Anglia Ruskin University holds up MacCormack’s ideas on climate, but also underscores her expertise in feminism, queer theory, posthuman ethics, animal studies, and horror films.
“Currently she is working on a new impact case study on inclusivity in mental health and criminal justice especially in relation with issues of sexual difference and Trans rights,” the university website reads.

395,"More than 400 women have applied to attend a candidate training session this weekend in Washington hosted by Emily’s List, an organization that works to elect women who support abortion rights, said spokeswoman Tonya Williams.",,reuters,abortion,center,20,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two years after filling the streets of U.S. cities to protest the start of Donald Trump’s presidency, women will march again this weekend to try to build political pressure against him ahead of the 2020 elections.
The loose movement around the marches has splintered as it enters its third year, and one of the various groups now involved has faced criticism it is anti-Semitic, which it denies. But leaders of the groups say momentum has not slowed, and the rallies will celebrate unprecedented gains for women in congressional and state races in last year’s midterm elections.
Millions of people took part in the women’s marches in Washington and other cities in the United States and abroad on Jan. 21, 2017, the day after the Republican president was sworn in.
Vanessa Wruble, a co-founder of the original Women’s March on Washington who left to start March On, a separate grassroots coalition, said the movement has evolved from being a reaction to Trump’s presidency.
It was “essentially the resistance movement, and now you see the movement being far more proactive,” she said.
Women’s March, a national nonprofit organization that evolved from the initial Washington march, is using its #WomensWave marches in Washington and elsewhere on Saturday to roll out a 10-part policy platform that includes raising the federal minimum wage and protecting reproductive rights.
“Women are just not on the agenda in this current administration,” Women’s March Chief Operating Officer Rachel Carmona said.
March On will kick off an initiative to mobilize women voters by hosting a “March on the Polls 2020” on Saturday in dozens of cities, including Boston and Denver.
Dozens of like-minded organizations will host training sessions for activists and prospective candidates.
More than 400 women have applied to attend a candidate training session this weekend in Washington hosted by Emily’s List, an organization that works to elect women who support abortion rights, said spokeswoman Tonya Williams.
Wruble said the 2018 elections showed the movement had “shifted the balance of power” in American politics. More women were elected to the U.S. Congress than ever before and many of the new Democratic women lawmakers cited Trump’s presidency among the reasons they decided to run for office.

Of course, women are not all united around the same causes. The annual “March for Life” by anti-abortion campaigners, which takes place in Washington on Friday, is a movement of people who broadly embrace Trump and Republicans.
GRASS-ROOTS EFFORTS
At the outset, March On was bankrolled by leaders covering expenses out of pocket, but it raised a “sizeable” amount of money in 2018 and aims to raise $2 million in 2019, Wruble said.
March On distributes funds to local affiliates for on-the-ground planning, provides design assistance for websites and logos and gives access to a public relations firm. In February and March, the group’s leaders will meet with affiliates to determine how best to support their efforts over the next election cycle.
“This year is really going to be about increasing our tool chest of what we offer to them,” said March On’s Natalie Sanchez, an organizer of the 2017 Boston Women’s March who is also with March Forward Massachusetts, which is leading Saturday’s march there.
The Women’s March now counts national progressive groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Move On among its partners. March On partners include the ACLU, Rock the Vote and Emerge America, which recruits Democratic women to run for office.
Women’s March’s Carmona said she spends 60 hours a week on planning calls, including “chapter” calls with 30 to 45 local organizations. The group did a 10-state tour ahead of last year’s congressional elections and is developing a nationwide strategy that would train more local leaders ahead of the 2020 presidential contest, she said.
There have been growing pains in a movement that grew out of hundreds of loosely affiliated marches in 2017.
In cities such as New York, there will be multiple events on Saturday hosted by different organizations, largely due to calls by some religious leaders to boycott Women’s March over criticism that some of its leaders are anti-Semitic.
Women’s March leader Linda Sarsour issued a statement condemning all forms of anti-Semitism and bigotry. Leaders Tamika Mallory and Bob Bland reiterated on ABC’s talk show program “The View” this week that they were committed to a movement that fought all forms of oppression.
Leaders of Women’s March and March On insist the divisions are not a weakness.

“I know there have been controversies this year and rifts and divides and those may or may not affect numbers on particular marches, but I haven’t seen that have any effect on the movement’s strength over all,” Wruble said.
Carmona said “there is a role for everyone” no matter which group they join, adding decentralized movements had a kind of power that is “hard to strike at.”",[]
400,The movement to ban or limit the use of natural gas in commercial and residential buildings opens a new front in the fight against climate change that could affect everything from heating systems in skyscrapers to stoves in suburban homes.,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-naturalgas-buildings/the-next-target-in-the-climate-change-debate-your-gas-stove-idUSKCN1VU18Q,reuters,environment,center,21,1,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Dozens of cities in liberal-leaning states such as California, Washington, and Massachusetts are studying proposals to ban or limit the use of natural gas in commercial and residential buildings. The movement opens a new front in the fight against climate change that could affect everything from heating systems in skyscrapers to stoves in suburban homes.
Berkeley, California, in July became the first U.S. city to pass an ordinance banning gas systems in new buildings, and it may soon be followed by many others, according to interviews with local officials, activists and industry groups. Los Angeles and Seattle are among those considering laws that could drastically reduce natural gas consumption.
“Berkeley is the opening salvo,” said Bruce Nilles, managing director of think tank Rocky Mountain Institute’s building electrification program.
Local officials and environmentalists cite mounting evidence that unburned gas leaking from pipes and compressor stations harms the climate more than carbon dioxide, the byproduct of burned fossil fuels.
Many environmentalists until recently considered natural gas a “bridge fuel” to a future of renewable energy because gas burns cleaner than oil or coal. Now local officials are stepping into what they call a federal regulatory void under the administration of President Donald Trump, who argues fossil-fuel restrictions needlessly damage the economy.
They want buildings switched to electric power from a grid that is increasingly powered by renewable energy. U.S. utilities currently derive about 35% of their electricity from gas but have also nearly doubled their use of renewable fuels in the past decade, from 9% to 17% of all power, according to the EIA.
Residential and commercial buildings account for about 12% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. They are also crucial to natural gas sales: Direct gas consumption amounted to about 8.45 trillion cubic feet in 2018, rivaling the 10.63 tcf used by utilities to power the grid, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).
If gas bans in buildings become widespread, they could upend the business models of some of the world's biggest energy companies, which are investing billions of dollars to produce and ship more natural gas on the belief the fuel will play a key role in the transition to a cleaner energy economy. Big gas producers including Exxon Mobil here (XOM.N), Shell here (RDSa.L), and BP here (BP.N), argue gas improves the environment by replacing dirtier fuels such as coal.
Natural gas companies alarmed by the trend are pushing back with ad campaigns and research promoting gas as a superior cooking fuel and an affordable option in a country that has become the world’s top gas producer.
“We are trying to get ahead of it,” said Stuart Saulters, the Director of Government Affairs of the American Public Gas Association. “We think there is a chance this can domino.”
The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the U.S. oil-and-gas industry, rejects claims that natural gas is bad for the environment, arguing its increased use has helped cut U.S. carbon emissions. Spokesman Reid Porter said that the industry is also limiting methane emissions with improved leak-prevention technology, citing data here from the Environmental Protection Agency showing a decline in recent years.
LOS ANGELES, SEATTLE, MINNEAPOLIS RETHINK NATURAL GAS
Nilles, of the Rocky Mountain Institute, said some 50 California municipalities are studying new limits on natural gas in buildings, including Silicon Valley-area cities such as Palo Alto, Sunnyvale and San Jose, the nation’s 10th most populous city. Los Angeles set a goal in April of powering all its buildings with renewable energy by 2050, starting with new buildings by 2030.
San Luis Obispo last week became the second city, after Berkeley, to pass a law limiting gas installations in new buildings. Kate Harrison, the Berkeley council member who spearheaded the city’s gas ban, said she has been contacted by dozens of cities studying similar measures in states including Massachusetts and Minnesota.
Officials in the Boston suburb of Brookline, for instance, will vote in November on a measure to ban gas hookups in new buildings. In Minnesota, three-quarters of the state’s residential heating - largely fueled by gas - would have to convert to electricity to meet the state’s goal of an 80% carbon emissions reduction by 2050, according to a report by the McKnight Foundation, a philanthropic organization.
New York City in April also passed a bill requiring buildings of more than 25,000 square feet to cut greenhouse emissions 40% by 2030 - a standard expected to reduce natural gas use.
Seattle City Council Member Mike O’Brien is working on legislation to ban gas hookups in new buildings. The fuel, he said, “is odorless and invisible but has a huge impact on the climate.”
HOT SHOWERS AND CRACKLING FIRES
The American Public Gas Association’s ad campaign is aimed at 25- to 44-year-old homeowners with incomes of more than $75,000, according to a slide presentation about it seen by Reuters. It features Facebook and Instagram ads showing people enjoying hot showers, cooking on gas stoves and relaxing by a firepit. Campaign director Saulters said it was one of the group’s most expensive promotional efforts to date, without disclosing its cost.
In July, a group called Californians for Balanced Energy Solutions - formed by Sempra Energy (SRE.N) unit SoCal Gas - held a press conference with Southern California restaurant owners who favor gas stoves.
“We need instant, really strong fire,” said Charles Lu, the owner of a Chinese restaurant chain who participated in the event. “Otherwise, I think it will kill the business.”
Wealthier homeowners may also resist electrification of kitchens and fireplaces, according to Nic Dunfee of environmental consulting firm TRC Companies Inc, who oversees an incentive program to rebuild homes in wildfire-stricken Sonoma County. Builders are pushing back on proposed mandates for electric stoves, he said at a recent meeting of California energy regulators.

“They don’t feel that they are able to sell a home that doesn’t have natural-gas cooking,” he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former CIA operative Valerie Plame failed in her bid for a seat in the U.S. Congress Wednesday, losing the Democratic nomination in New Mexico’s 3rd District to an attorney with deep roots in the state, Teresa Leger Fernandez.
Plame had raised over $2 million, more than anyone on the ballot for the House of Representatives seat in the solidly Democratic district, and she had released a flashy campaign video of her speeding across the desert in a sports car.
But she couldn’t shake criticism that she was an outsider compared to Leger Fernandez, who has served as counsel to several Native American tribes in the northern New Mexico district and had the backing of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.
“I’m sorry last night didn’t turn out the way we hoped,” Plame wrote on Twitter.
Plame moved to Santa Fe over a decade ago after her cover as a spy was blown by officials in then-President George W. Bush’s administration.
According to preliminary results from the New Mexico Secretary of State’s office, Leger Fernandez took 41% of the vote, while Plame had 24.5%. State Representative Joseph Sanchez was third with 13%.
The seat is open because the current congressman, Democrat Ben Ray Lujan, is running for the Senate.",['criticism']
411,"In an article posted by NBC News on Monday, the AP argues that even erstwhile allies, like tennis great and gay activist Martina Navratilova, can become resentful of transgender women dominating their sport.",http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/iBeQzweSWhA/,breitbart,sport,right,21,1,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"As biological males and other trans athletes continue to rack-up an impressive record of victory while competing against biological females, a recent article by the Associated Press sounds the alarm over the “resentment,” that success might bring.
In an article posted by NBC News on Monday, the AP argues that even erstwhile allies, like tennis great and gay activist Martina Navratilova, can become resentful of transgender women dominating their sport.
The AP wrote:
Exhibit A is a recent public exchange involving tennis great Martina Navratilova, who came out as a lesbian in 1981 and is a longtime gay-rights activist. She now stands accused of being “transphobic” after asserting that many transgender women — even if they’ve undergone hormone treatment — have an unfair advantage over other female competitors. ‘A man can decide to be female, take hormones if required by whatever sporting organization is concerned, win everything in sight and perhaps earn a small fortune, and then reverse his decision and go back to making babies if he so desires,’ Navratilova wrote in a Feb. 17 op-ed for The Sunday Times of London. ‘It’s insane and it’s cheating.’ Supporters of trans inclusion in sports were aghast. One advocacy group, Athlete Ally, ousted Navratilova from its advisory board and said she would no longer be designated one of its ambassadors. ‘Trans women athletes aren’t looking to take over women’s sport,’ Athlete Ally said. ‘They are women and want to compete in the sport they love, just as any other athlete would.’
Though, whether transgender women (biological males) intend to take over women’s sports or not. The fact of the matter is that’s exactly what’s happening. Transgender female runners took first and second place recently, in the Connecticut track and field championships.
Much to the dismay of natural born female competitors like Selina Soule, who believe that male competitors make the competition feel rigged.
“We all know the outcome of the race before it even starts; it’s demoralizing,” biologically female teen runner Selina Soule said. “I fully support and am happy for these athletes for being true to themselves. They should have the right to express themselves in school, but athletics have always had extra rules to keep the competition fair.”
In addition, a 6-3 250 pound Australian handball player named Hannah Mouncey — a biological male — is the most physically dominating force in that sport.
However, according to champion transgender track cyclist Rachel McKinnon, the notion that transgender women will come to dominate women’s sports, is an “irrational fear.”
“No such thing will ever happen,” McKinnon wrote. “This is an irrational fear of trans women.”
LGBTQ-rights activist Helen Carroll, believes there’s a hypocrisy in the criticism of trans athletes. Chiefly, that people seem okay with trans athletes as long as they are losing. Though, if the trans athletes are winning, only then do people really start to care.
“As long as trans people are losing and are not the best, everything is OK,” Carroll said. “As soon as they start winning, that’s when the vitriol comes out about how they’re really still a man.”
As an example of this resentment, the AP uses the victory of trans woman mountain biker Michelle Dumaresq, who won the national title in 2006. As the AP writes, “second-place finisher Danika Schroeter donned a T-shirt provided by her boyfriend during the medal ceremony. It read: “100% Pure Woman Champ.
“Dumaresq later told The National Post, a Canadian newspaper, ‘That was the moment I stopped loving the sport. … That kind of wrecked it for me.’
The article even took aim at Breitbart, for accurately reporting the biological gender of transgender female cyclist Rachel McKinnon, after winning a track cycling championship in October.
Breitbart.com headlined its story, ‘Biological Man Wins Women’s World Cycling Championship,’ helping to trigger an avalanche of social-media attacks against McKinnon. ‘I’m immensely proud of my accomplishment,’ McKinnon wrote a few days later. ‘But not all of it has been positive. … I’d say the negative comments have outweighed the positive by about 3,000 to one.’
Of course, the Breitbart headline cannot be factually disputed. Nor, for that matter, can the Associated Press headline. Resentment does exist, in some cases, for transgender female athletes. However, much of that resentment is coming from women. Who, at least until recently, the ideological left had at least pretended to care about.
Was feminism and the advancement of women’s participation in sports just a passing fad? Did it go out of style? Exactly when and where did feminism lose the intersectional war with transgender rights?
Moreover, when did the left abandon the principles of science and fairness?
Democrat politicians have never shied away from reminding Americans of all the unfair practices that keep women from having success in the workplace. Yet, now that women are facing far more unfairness in the world of sports, not only does the left act as though the unfairness doesn’t exist, but cheers it on? What could be more anti-woman than actively rooting for an competitive arrangement where women are doomed to fail?
For whatever reason, it appears that the ideological left has abandoned women at the altar.

418,"Bennett is seen immediately unleashing a tirade against Pan as he walks beside the politician, who tries to ignore, then laugh off his antagonist.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-crime-vaccines/anti-vaccine-activist-charged-for-assault-of-california-senator-idUSKCN1VC06U,reuters,vaccines,center,21,1,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - The man behind a petition drive to recall a California state senator and physician pushing for tougher vaccine requirements was charged on Wednesday with assault after livestreaming himself shoving the lawmaker in a sidewalk confrontation in Sacramento.
Kenneth Austin Bennett, 54, known for presenting his anti-vaccine views and various conspiracy theories on social media, posted self-recorded video on his own Facebook page showing him accosting Senator Richard Pan during what appears as a chance encounter on the street.
Bennett is seen immediately unleashing a tirade against Pan as he walks beside the politician, who tries to ignore, then laugh off his antagonist. Bennett then thrusts his hand into the lawmaker’s back and pushes him sharply from behind, sending Pan stumbling forward.
The lawmaker whips around to briefly face Bennett, pointing his fingers at him, shouting “Hey, hey,” then turns back around abruptly and walks away as he and a companion take out their cell phones, presumably to report the incident.
Pan, a Sacramento Democrat and medical doctor, is then seen ducking into a nearby restaurant. Bennett continues the livestream, filming himself as he acknowledges out loud, “I probably shouldn’t have done that.”
He goes on to accuse Pan of “poisoning our children,” adding, “If he got what he deserved, he would be hanged for treason, for assaulting children, for misrepresenting the truth.”
Bennett mounted an unsuccessful primary election challenge to Pan in 2018 and failed to qualify for the general election. In May, he launched a recall campaign against Pan, filing a petition accusing him of “high treason” for authoring legislation to restrict vaccine exemptions for school children.
Sacramento police called to investigate Wednesday’s confrontation, which occurred blocks away from the state Capitol, cited Bennett with misdemeanor assault, and he was released, police spokesman Marcus Basquez said.
Pan was not hurt, Basquez said.
State Senate President pro Tempore Toni Atkins later decried the incident in a statement saying fellow legislators would assist in investigating the matter.
“There is absolutely no reason for resorting to violence,” she said. “This is a place where laws are meant to be made, not broken.”
Pan’s spokeswoman, Shannan Velayas, was quoted by the Los Angeles Times as saying her boss has routinely been targeted by anti-vaccine activists since he introduced a bill in 2015 creating strict vaccine requirements for school children.
She said his more recent bill to further tighten vaccine laws has prompted a new round of threats.
“This is moving from a peculiar fringe curiosity to a violent extremist movement,” Velayas told the newspaper.","['tirade', 'unleashing']"

The measles virus has infected more than 4,200 in the South Pacific nation of just 200,000, government data shows, spurring medical teams to go door-to-door this week to vaccinate families still susceptible to the highly contagious disease.
The government urged unvaccinated families to hang a red cloth or flag outside homes as a signal for help, and imposed the shutdown to free up resources for its vaccine drive and keep even those fearful of vaccines home for the teams’ visits.
“Families are getting conflicting messages and it’s hard for them to then know what is the best thing for their child,” said Cate Heinrich, a Pacific spokeswoman at U.N. children’s agency UNICEF.
“It’s been a problem in Samoa but also globally with the anti-vaxxers,” she said, referring to groups that advocate against vaccines.
Measles cases are rising worldwide, even in wealthy nations such as Germany and the United States, as immunisation is shunned for philosophical or religious reasons, or even fears, debunked by doctors, that vaccines cause autism or other woes.
The virus took hold in Samoa last month after devastating communities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Ukraine, among others.
SOCIAL MEDIA
The devastating appearance of measles in Samoa has triggered conflicting advice on social media, especially on Facebook, which is a hugely popular platform in the Pacific.
Overseas networks originating in places such as North America have linked up with Samoans to send vitamins to the Pacific, say posts on social media, accompanied by claims that many cases may be caused by the vaccine.
Such assertions were absurd - and dangerous, said Dr Richard Kidd, an official of the Australian Medical Association.
“There are some people who can never be vaccinated because they might have allergies or they have serious immune problems and that’s why the rest of us need to share the responsibility to protect those who can’t,” Kidd added.
Vaccine rates in Samoa were just about 31% when measles took hold, the World Health Organization (WHO) says, a far lower proportion than in neighbours, such as Fiji and Tonga, where the disease has been more contained.
Kidd said a nation required a target coverage rate of 95% to reach “herd immunity”, or the ability to stop a disease from spreading.
In just over two weeks, the death toll has jumped more than tenfold to 62 on Thursday, the Samoan government said.
Samoan authorities have blamed low coverage rates in part to fears sparked by the deaths of two babies last year after vaccinations that put a temporary halt on immunisation efforts.
Although the deaths were found to have been caused by medications that were wrongly prepared, the tragedy prompted anti-vaccination groups to warn against immunisations in Samoa.
Online efforts by medical professionals to combat anti-vaccination groups include a chatbot named Mitara designed by two New Zealand doctors to answer questions about the disease on Facebook.
“If we are not putting our voices out there on social media, then suddenly peoples’ timelines and newsfeeds will be filled with masses of anti-vaxx content,” said Canaan Aumua, who designed the bot along with colleague Sanjeev Krishna.
“Samoans are our heaviest users at the moment.”",[]

(Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden promised black community leaders in Delaware on Monday he would earn their support amid nationwide police brutality protests, saying he would create a police oversight board within his first 100 days in the White House.
Biden, who met with more than a dozen black leaders in a church in Wilmington, also said he would soon unveil an economic plan to deal with the disproportionate toll on the black and Latino communities from the coronavirus outbreak.
“I’ve never taken you for granted,” Biden, who visited a protest site on Sunday, told the leaders after sitting quietly and taking note of their concerns. “It has to be earned, earned every single time.”
Cities across the country awoke from a smoldering weekend of violent protests over race and policing sparked by the death of a black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody last Monday.
Biden said his economic plan would include components on housing, education and access to capital in the black community.
“We’re going to make sure that the economic recovery deals with the institutional structures, the institutional racism,” said Biden, who wore a mask as he listened and pulled it down to talk.
Biden’s appearance was a contrast with the approach of Republican President Donald Trump, who has made no major public statement to address the growing crisis but issued tweets as he remained out of sight in the White House. He was due on Monday to meet his top law enforcement officer and hold a call with governors, law enforcement and national security officials.
The community leaders at Wilmington’s Bethel AME Church urged Biden to pick a black vice presidential running mate, and said the protests were a reflection of frustration about the lack of attention and resources for African-American communities.
“Young people out there are going mad” from a lack of effort to address their problems, said Bishop Thomas Wesley Weeks, pastor at New Destiny Fellowship in Wilmington. Weeks and others said the choice of a black running mate would show Biden’s commitment to one of the Democratic Party’s most loyal constituencies.
“A black female will overwhelm and excite and turn the heads of these young people and everybody out there,” Weeks said.
Biden, who has promised his No. 2 will be a woman, told the group several black women were on his list of potential running mates.
Last month, Biden apologized for telling a black radio host that he “ain’t black” if he was still weighing whether to support him or Trump in the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election.

Biden has chafed at being stuck in his Delaware home during the coronavirus outbreak, and a Biden adviser said there was an internal divide on whether to get Biden out on the trail, with his wife Jill resisting.
“I can tell you with confidence that Joe wants to get out there, Jill doesn’t want him too. She knows her husband and it’s impossible for him not hug or handshake,” the adviser said.
Floyd’s death was the latest in a string of similar incidents involving unarmed black men in recent years that have raised an outcry over excessive police force and racism.",['promised']

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has only been in Congress for a matter of months, but in that short period of time she's been able to prompt widespread outrage and catch the attention of some of America's most prominent politicians.
The self-described Democratic Socialist has attracted criticism and surprise over controversial policies like the ""Green New Deal,"" as well as her unorthodox political views that seemed to stun people on both sides of the aisle.
On Tuesday, AOC once again ignited a media firestorm when she continued bashing President Trump's administration by alluding to a term used to describe the horrific conditions Jews endured during the Holocaust. Here's a review of that comment and the many others that seemed to lead one pundit to dub her ""the most powerful Democrat in office.""
TOMI LAHREN: ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ IS RIGHT ABOUT THIS (YES, I MEAN IT)...
Labeling Trump's migrant centers 'concentration camps'
In what were perhaps her most controversial comments to date, AOC alluded to Nazi Germany while describing the way Trump detained migrant families on the border. ""The fact that concentration camps are now an institutionalized practice in the land of the free is extraordinarily disturbing,"" she said during a livestream that went viral on social media.
Her comments quickly caught the attention of her colleague, House GOP Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. Cheney, among others, suggested that the freshman congresswoman was grossly ignorant of history and disrespected Jews by bringing up a term often used to describe their imprisonment under the Nazis.
But Ocasio-Cortez and many others suggested her comments weren't outrageous because ""concentration camps"" were markedly different than the ""death camps"" that Holocaust victims experienced. Some weren't buying it, though, and Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Mark Morgan -- whose agency is partially responsible for detaining migrants -- even weighed in, calling her comments ""reckless, irresponsible, misinformed and wrong.""
AOC ATTACK GROUP TARGETS TOP DEM -- WHO VOTED WITH HER 96% OF THE TIME BUT CRITICIZED OMAR
The world will end in 12 years because of climate change
AOC started her congressional term with a bang -- proposing a multitrillion-dollar plan that would radically alter the economy with the goal of reducing carbon emissions. Initially dismissed as absurd by critics, her ""Green New Deal"" eventually made its way into Democratic presidential candidate's official policies.
While decrying the impacts of climate change in January, AOC seemed to conjure the most frequent conservative criticism of progressives on the issue -- namely, that they blow the threat way out of proportion. AOC not only invoked World War II, but suggested that the world would ""end in 12 years."" “Millennials and people, you know, Gen Z and all these folks that will come after us are looking up and we’re like: ‘The world is gonna end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change and your biggest issue is how are we gonna pay for it?'"" she said.

Amazon pays its workers 'starvation wages'
As a ""Democratic Socialist,"" AOC has joined her colleagues -- Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., -- in fiercely criticizing big corporations for their purported greed and oppression of working class Americans.
In June, the freshman congresswoman doubled down on her previous criticism of one of the biggest U.S. corporations -- online retail giant Amazon -- and claimed CEO Jeff Bezos was able to make billions in part because he paid his workers ""starvation wages.""
That obviously didn't go over well with Amazon which blasted her allegations as ""absurd."" ""Amazon associates receive industry-leading pay starting at $15 an hour,"" an Amazon spokesperson said, citing the pay rate AOC and other progressives sought to install as the federal minimum wage.

Cauliflower isn't just something you grow in a garden -- it's an outgrowth of colonialism
As part of AOC's emphasis on race, she has derided as so-called ""colonial"" acts that the alleged perpetrators don't even realize were oppressive. She warned, for example, that New Yorkers should be wary of blindly planting food like Cauliflower in the Bronx.
During a video, AOC addressed people who complained that planting Yucca -- a plant often found in Mexico and Guatemala -- was too difficult. Where they apparently saw an attempt to avoid cumbersome gardening, she saw a perpetuation of imperial conquest. “But when you really think about it -- when someone says that it’s ‘too hard’ to do a green space that grows Yucca instead of, I don’t know, cauliflower or something -- what you’re doing is you’re taking a colonial approach to environmentalism,” she said.
“That is why a lot of communities of color get resistant to certain environmentalist movements because they come with the colonial lens on them.” Those comments seemed to foreshadow AOC's later claim that people were perpetuating ""the legacy of colonization"" when they pushed for Puerto Rican statehood.

Border agents are caging children and injecting them with drugs
AOC's concentration camp comments weren't the first time she blasted the way children were treated at the border. During a long Instagram session in April, the New York congresswoman appeared to accuse Customs and Border Protection agents of forcibly injecting child migrants with drugs and putting them in cages.
“At least I’m not trying to cage children at the border and inject them with drugs,” she told viewers. “That’s not a mistake. That is a deliberate policy to attack people based on their national origin. That’s not a mistake, that’s just hatred. That’s just cruelty. That’s just wrong!” She seemed to be referring to an earlier lawsuit claiming migrant children were forced to take psychotropic medication.

450,"Samoa on Thursday closed all non-essential public and private services for two days to combat a measles epidemic that has killed more than 60 people, mostly babies and children, in a battle complicated by a vocal anti-vaccination movement.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-measles-samoa/samoa-fights-measles-door-to-door-in-battle-on-anti-vaccination-messages-idUSKBN1Y9033,reuters,vaccines,center,23,1,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Samoa on Thursday closed all non-essential public and private services for two days to combat a measles epidemic that has killed more than 60 people, mostly babies and children, in a battle complicated by a vocal anti-vaccination movement.
The measles virus has infected more than 4,200 in the South Pacific nation of just 200,000, government data shows, spurring medical teams to go door-to-door this week to vaccinate families still susceptible to the highly contagious disease.
The government urged unvaccinated families to hang a red cloth or flag outside homes as a signal for help, and imposed the shutdown to free up resources for its vaccine drive and keep even those fearful of vaccines home for the teams’ visits.
“Families are getting conflicting messages and it’s hard for them to then know what is the best thing for their child,” said Cate Heinrich, a Pacific spokeswoman at U.N. children’s agency UNICEF.
“It’s been a problem in Samoa but also globally with the anti-vaxxers,” she said, referring to groups that advocate against vaccines.
Measles cases are rising worldwide, even in wealthy nations such as Germany and the United States, as immunisation is shunned for philosophical or religious reasons, or even fears, debunked by doctors, that vaccines cause autism or other woes.
The virus took hold in Samoa last month after devastating communities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Ukraine, among others.
SOCIAL MEDIA
The devastating appearance of measles in Samoa has triggered conflicting advice on social media, especially on Facebook, which is a hugely popular platform in the Pacific.
Overseas networks originating in places such as North America have linked up with Samoans to send vitamins to the Pacific, say posts on social media, accompanied by claims that many cases may be caused by the vaccine.
Such assertions were absurd - and dangerous, said Dr Richard Kidd, an official of the Australian Medical Association.
“There are some people who can never be vaccinated because they might have allergies or they have serious immune problems and that’s why the rest of us need to share the responsibility to protect those who can’t,” Kidd added.
Vaccine rates in Samoa were just about 31% when measles took hold, the World Health Organization (WHO) says, a far lower proportion than in neighbours, such as Fiji and Tonga, where the disease has been more contained.
Kidd said a nation required a target coverage rate of 95% to reach “herd immunity”, or the ability to stop a disease from spreading.
In just over two weeks, the death toll has jumped more than tenfold to 62 on Thursday, the Samoan government said.
Samoan authorities have blamed low coverage rates in part to fears sparked by the deaths of two babies last year after vaccinations that put a temporary halt on immunisation efforts.
Although the deaths were found to have been caused by medications that were wrongly prepared, the tragedy prompted anti-vaccination groups to warn against immunisations in Samoa.
Online efforts by medical professionals to combat anti-vaccination groups include a chatbot named Mitara designed by two New Zealand doctors to answer questions about the disease on Facebook.
“If we are not putting our voices out there on social media, then suddenly peoples’ timelines and newsfeeds will be filled with masses of anti-vaxx content,” said Canaan Aumua, who designed the bot along with colleague Sanjeev Krishna.

Powell, a Republican who led the U.S. military during the 1991 Gulf War in Iraq under President George H.W. Bush and later headed the State Department under President George W. Bush, said Trump “lies all the time,” has “drifted away” from the U.S. Constitution and poses a danger to American democracy.
“I cannot in any way support President Trump this year,” Powell, who did not vote for the Republican president in 2016, told CNN. Trump responded by calling Powell a “real stiff” on Twitter.
The criticism comes as the nation faces a trio of crises: widespread protests over police violence against black men and women, the coronavirus pandemic and a sharp economic downturn. It is rare for Republicans to criticize Trump directly, and more so for members of the military establishment, who typically stay out of politics.
Trump’s former defense secretary, retired General Jim Mattis, last week denounced what he called Trump’s “deliberate” efforts to divide the country. Former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairmen Michael Mullen and Martin Dempsey have also criticized Trump’s handling of the unrest.
Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski said last week that she was “struggling” with whether to support Trump’s reelection, while Republican Senator Mitt Romney praised Mattis’ words.
The New York Times reported on Saturday that George W. Bush would not vote for Trump, citing sources close to the only living Republican former president.
Many of the Republicans now criticizing Trump also did not vote for him in 2016.
Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, said in a statement, “President Trump has record support within the Republican Party, however the adoration of the liberal Beltway media is alluring and powerfully attractive to some DC insiders.”
Since winning the White House, Trump has secured an iron grip on Republican loyalty. Many former critics, such as Senator Lindsay Graham, have become ardent backers.
CONCERNED REPUBLICANS
Several Republican groups have formed to oppose Trump’s reelection, including a super PAC, the Lincoln Project, and a new initiative called Republican Voters Against Trump, which last week kicked off a $10 million digital ad campaign.
“There are legions of privately concerned Republicans in Washington,” said Tim Miller, who advised Republican Jeb Bush’s 2016 presidential campaign and helped launch Republicans Voting Against Trump.
“That doesn’t do a whole lot for me. If you’re not willing to say it, you may as well put on the red hat,” he added, referring to Trump’s signature campaign baseball cap.
Powell said he would vote for Biden, going a step further than some other Republicans who have said they do not support Trump but have not backed his Democratic rival.

“I haven’t voted for him, so I’m not going to start now, but that’s a different question from actively supporting Biden,” said Mark Sanford, the former Republican South Carolina governor who mounted a brief primary challenge to Trump last year.
The public denunciations from figures including Powell and Murkowski could sway more Republicans, Sanford said.

(Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden promised black community leaders in Delaware on Monday he would earn their support amid nationwide police brutality protests, saying he would create a police oversight board within his first 100 days in the White House.
Biden, who met with more than a dozen black leaders in a church in Wilmington, also said he would soon unveil an economic plan to deal with the disproportionate toll on the black and Latino communities from the coronavirus outbreak.
“I’ve never taken you for granted,” Biden, who visited a protest site on Sunday, told the leaders after sitting quietly and taking note of their concerns. “It has to be earned, earned every single time.”
Cities across the country awoke from a smoldering weekend of violent protests over race and policing sparked by the death of a black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody last Monday.
Biden said his economic plan would include components on housing, education and access to capital in the black community.
“We’re going to make sure that the economic recovery deals with the institutional structures, the institutional racism,” said Biden, who wore a mask as he listened and pulled it down to talk.
Biden’s appearance was a contrast with the approach of Republican President Donald Trump, who has made no major public statement to address the growing crisis but issued tweets as he remained out of sight in the White House. He was due on Monday to meet his top law enforcement officer and hold a call with governors, law enforcement and national security officials.
The community leaders at Wilmington’s Bethel AME Church urged Biden to pick a black vice presidential running mate, and said the protests were a reflection of frustration about the lack of attention and resources for African-American communities.
“Young people out there are going mad” from a lack of effort to address their problems, said Bishop Thomas Wesley Weeks, pastor at New Destiny Fellowship in Wilmington. Weeks and others said the choice of a black running mate would show Biden’s commitment to one of the Democratic Party’s most loyal constituencies.
“A black female will overwhelm and excite and turn the heads of these young people and everybody out there,” Weeks said.
Biden, who has promised his No. 2 will be a woman, told the group several black women were on his list of potential running mates.
Last month, Biden apologized for telling a black radio host that he “ain’t black” if he was still weighing whether to support him or Trump in the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election.

The announcement, made on Twitter by the head of Google’s Threat Analysis Group, Shane Huntley, is the latest indication of the digital spying routinely aimed at top politicians.
Huntley said there was “no sign of compromise” of either campaign.
Iranian attempts to break into Trump campaign officials’ emails have been documented before. Last year, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) announced that a group often nicknamed Charming Kitten had tried to break into email accounts belonging to an unnamed U.S. presidential campaign, which sources identified as Trump’s.
Earlier this year, the threat intelligence company Area 1 Security said Russian hackers had targeted companies tied to a Ukrainian gas firm where Biden’s son once served on the board.
Google declined to offer details beyond Huntley’s tweets, but the unusually public attribution is a sign of how sensitive Americans have become to digital espionage efforts aimed at political campaigns.
“We sent the targeted users our standard government-backed attack warning and we referred this information to federal law enforcement,” a Google representative said.
Hacking to interfere in elections has become a concern for governments, especially since U.S intelligence agencies concluded that Russia ran a hacking and propaganda operation to disrupt the American democratic process in 2016 to help then-candidate Trump become president. Among the targets was digital infrastructure used by 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign here
Moscow has denied any meddling.
Attempts by foreign adversaries to break into presidential campaigns are commonplace but the unusually public attribution offered by Google is a sign of how sensitive Americans have become to digital espionage efforts aimed at candidates.
“We are aware of reports from Google that a foreign actor has made unsuccessful attempts to access the personal email accounts of campaign staff,” a Biden campaign spokesman said. “We have known from the beginning of our campaign that we would be subject to such attacks and we are prepared for them.”
The Trump campaign, the Chinese Embassy in Washington and the Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Charming Kitten, the group identified by Google as being responsible for the targeting of the Trump campaign, has also recently hit the headlines over other exploits, including the targeting of the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O).
Earlier this year, Reuters tied the group to attempts to impersonate high-profile media figures and journalists.
John Hultquist, senior director of intelligence analysis with U.S. cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc (FEYE.O), described the two hacking groups as “espionage actors” and said they were likely attempting to collect intelligence rather than steal material to leak online.

573,"Even so, the results offer fresh evidence that concerns about women’s emotional health after an abortion shouldn’t factor into policies about legal access to these procedures, said Julia Steinberg, a researcher at the University of Maryland, College Park, who wasn’t involved in the study.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-abortion-regret/women-rarely-regret-decision-to-get-abortion-idUSKBN1ZJ1WB?feedType=RSS&feedName=healthNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FhealthNews+%28Reuters+Health+News%29,reuters,abortion,center,29,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"(Reuters Health) -
Five years after an abortion, most women still say it was the right decision even if they struggled with their choice at the time, a U.S. study suggests.
Researchers surveyed 667 women who had abortions in 21 states a week after they had the procedures and then once every six months for five years. By the end of that period, 84% of women had either positive or neutral feelings about their choice.
“We found no evidence of emergent negative emotions about the abortion over the five years,” said study leader Corinne Rocca of the University of California, San Francisco.
“In fact, of all the emotions we looked at, relief remained the most commonly reported one at all times, even five years out,” Rocca said by email.
Opponents of abortion have argued against legal access to these procedures in part because of concerns that abortion harms women by causing negative emotions and regret, researchers note in Social Science and Medicine. This idea has contributed to state laws and court decisions limiting abortion as well as state policies requiring women seeking abortions to be warned it might cause lasting emotional or mental health harm, the study team notes.
For the current analysis, researchers asked women who got abortions the degree to which they felt emotions like relief, happiness, regret, guilt, sadness and anger. They also asked women whether they still thought the choice they made was the right one.
At the start of the study, participants were 25 years old, on average, and 62% were already raising children.
Slightly more than half felt the decision to have an abortion was “very difficult” or “somewhat difficult.” Women were more likely to feel this way when they perceived higher levels of stigma surrounded the decision to get an abortion.
One week after their abortions, 51% of women felt mostly positive about their decisions, while 17% felt mostly negative and 12% felt a mix of both emotions. Another 20% reported feeling few emotions, or none at all, related to their decision.
After five years, anger was the only emotion that was more common among women who perceived high levels of stigma about abortion, the study also found.
One week after the abortion, 98% of women felt they had made the right decision, as did 99% of women five years later.
One limitation of the study is that asking women about their emotions may have prompted them to report stronger feelings than they might have otherwise experienced, the study team notes.
Even so, the results offer fresh evidence that concerns about women’s emotional health after an abortion shouldn’t factor into policies about legal access to these procedures, said Julia Steinberg, a researcher at the University of Maryland, College Park, who wasn’t involved in the study.
“Abortion does not lead to decision regret or negative emotions, negative emotions or regret do not emerge over time after the abortion, and women overwhelmingly feel the decision was the right one initially and over the entire five years after an abortion, even if they had difficulty making it,” Steinberg said by email.
Just because women struggled with the decision to get an abortion doesn’t mean it was the wrong choice for them, said Nada Stotland of Rush University in Chicago.
“It’s reassuring to women contemplating abortion that they are very unlikely to regret it, but there is no valid evidence whatever that women, including adolescents, can’t make the best decisions for themselves, their circumstances, and their families,” Stotland, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.

580,"Britain will ban the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars from 2035, five years earlier than planned, in an attempt to reduce air pollution that could herald the end of over a century of reliance on the internal combustion engine.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-accord/electric-dream-britain-to-ban-new-petrol-and-hybrid-cars-from-2035-idUSKBN1ZX2RY,reuters,environment,center,30,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will ban the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars from 2035, five years earlier than planned, in an attempt to reduce air pollution that could herald the end of over a century of reliance on the internal combustion engine.
The step amounts to a victory for electric cars that if copied globally could hit the wealth of oil producers, as well as transform the car industry and one of the icons of 20th Century capitalism: the automobile itself.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seeking to use the announcement to elevate the United Kingdom’s environmental credentials after he sacked the head of a Glasgow U.N. Climate Change Conference planned for November known as COP26.
“We have to deal with our CO2 emissions,” Johnson said at a launch event for COP26 at London’s Science Museum on Tuesday. “As a country and as a society, as a planet, as a species, we must now act.”
The government said that, subject to consultation, it would end the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars and vans in 2035, or earlier if a faster transition was possible.
Countries and cities around the world have announced plans to crack down on diesel vehicles following the 2015 Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) emissions scandal and the EU is introducing tougher carbon dioxide rules.
The mayors of Paris, Madrid, Mexico City and Athens have said they plan to ban diesel vehicles from city centres by 2025. France is preparing to ban the sale of fossil fuel-powered cars by 2040.
While demand for electric vehicles has surged in Britain, Europe’s second-largest market for new vehicles, diesel and petrol models still account for 90% of sales. Prospective buyers of greener models are worried about the limited availability of charging points, the range of certain models and the cost.
The government said last year it was providing an extra 2.5 million pounds ($3.25 million) to fund the installation of more than 1,000 new charge points for electric vehicles on residential streets.

ELECTRIC DREAM?
While some automakers may find it hard to countenance the end of the combustion engine, others have embraced a future in which electric vehicles prevail.
Ford (F.N), Volkswagen and Vauxhall are Britain’s biggest-selling car manufacturers, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Tesla (TSLA.O), Mitsubishi (7211.T) and BMW (BMWG.DE) produce the top three selling electric cars in Britain.
Although the ban will not come into force for another 15 years, the change will affect decision-making sooner as carmakers decide on investments long before a vehicle first rolls off a production line with a model life cycle lasting around seven years.
The ban poses a threat to German jobs as Britain is the biggest export market for its car manufacturers, amounting to about 20% of global sales, and electric cars take less time to build than combustion-engined or hybrid variants.

Johnson also signalled that a phase-out of Britain’s coal-fired power plants would be brought forward by a year to 2024. Coal provides just 3% of the country’s electricity, down from 70% three decades ago, he said.

Bolstered by Trump’s appointment of two conservative justices, the nine-member court could soon begin to pare back abortion rights, starting with a major case from Louisiana that is one of several similar pending appeals.
The addition of Trump appointees Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch could alter the conservative-majority court’s approach to abortion. Kavanaugh replaced Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who backed abortion rights in key rulings in 1992 and 2016.
Jennifer Popik, director of federal legislation for the anti-abortion National Right to Life Committee, said her group hopes Kavanaugh and Gorsuch will “interpret the Constitution more narrowly” on abortion rights.
In Congress, legislation backed by Trump’s fellow Republicans already has been introduced to restrict late-term abortions along the lines discussed by Trump, but there are not enough votes to pass it given Democratic opposition.
Abortion is one of the most contentious issues in U.S. politics. Trump, whose abortion views have been fluid over the years, has emerged as an advocate of more restrictions, a position that appeals to his conservative voter base.
His address on Tuesday night in some ways kicked off his 2020 re-election campaign. His call for new limits on late-term abortions was welcomed by anti-abortion activists.
When he ran for president in 2016, Trump said he would appoint anti-abortion judges who would vote to overturn the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling Roe v. Wade that recognized a woman’s constitutional right to abortion and legalized the procedure nationwide.
In his State of the Union address, Trump criticized a New York law and legislation in Virginia that would in limited circumstances allow for late-term abortions when the mother’s health is endangered.
“To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb,” Trump said during the speech, without specifying details.
A White House spokeswoman said Trump backs legislation pending in Congress that would ban abortions after 20 weeks.
‘SMOKE AND MIRRORS’
Jennifer Dalven, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which backs abortion rights, called Trump’s comments “smoke and mirrors.”
“This is really just a distraction. The goal is not to end a certain class of abortion. His goal is to end all abortions,” Dalven added.
There is no nationwide law setting a specific limit on when in a pregnancy abortions can be performed. Each state has its own laws, with conservative states imposing restrictions and liberal states more broadly backing abortion rights.
Republicans have embraced the federal legislation to ban abortion after 20 weeks. But past bills have failed to overcome Democratic opposition, even when Republicans controlled both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
With the House now led by Democrats and the Senate by Republicans, there is even less chance of such legislation passing, though Republicans said on Wednesday they would press for a vote.
As of the end of last year, 17 states had laws banning abortions 20 weeks after fertilization, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research organization that supports abortion rights. No states categorically ban all late-term abortions in all circumstances and 43 states have laws that impose at least some restrictions, it said.
The Roe v. Wade ruling, reaffirmed by the high court in 1992, concluded that abortion could not be banned before the fetus is viable, but gave states leeway to impose greater restrictions on it toward the end of a pregnancy.
In 2007, the court upheld a federal restriction on “partial-birth abortions” that involve a physician removing most of the fetus intact rather than dismembering it.
In its most recent major abortion ruling, the Supreme Court - with Kennedy joining the court’s four liberals in the majority - in 2016 struck down regulations in Texas that abortion rights advocates said would shutter many clinics.

The Louisiana case pending before the justices resembles the Texas case. It involves a requirement that doctors who perform abortions have a difficult-to-obtain arrangement called “admitting privileges” at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic.
The provision was challenged by abortion rights advocates. If the court rejects their request, it would represent a shift away from the 2016 ruling following Kennedy’s retirement.
The court will also decide soon whether to hear Indiana’s bid to revive a state ban on abortions performed due to the sex or race of the fetus or evidence of disability. Indiana this week asked the Supreme Court to hear another abortion case concerning a law to require fetal ultrasounds before abortions take place.","['urged', 'divisive']"
610,"Confusion, complaints of missing mail-in ballots and long lines at some polling centers marred primary elections on Tuesday in eight states and the District of Columbia, the biggest test yet of voting during the coronavirus outbreak.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election/confusion-long-lines-at-some-poll-sites-as-eight-u-s-states-vote-during-coronavirus-pandemic-idUSKBN2391B5,reuters,elections-2020,center,31,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Confusion, complaints of missing mail-in ballots and long lines at some polling centers marred primary elections on Tuesday in eight states and the District of Columbia, the biggest test yet of voting during the coronavirus outbreak.
The most extensive balloting since the pandemic sparked lockdowns in mid-March served as a dry run for the Nov. 3 general election. It offered a glimpse of the challenges ahead on a national scale if that vote is conducted under a lingering threat from COVID-19.
All of the states voting on Tuesday encouraged or expanded mail-in balloting as a safe alternative during the outbreak, and most sharply reduced the number of in-person polling places as officials struggled to recruit workers to run them.
That led to record numbers of mail-in ballots requested and cast in many states, along with complaints over not receiving requested ballots and questions about where to vote after polling places were consolidated.
Pennsylvania and three of the other states voting - Indiana, Maryland and Rhode Island - had delayed their nominating contests from earlier in the year to avoid the worst of the coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 106,000 people in the United States. Iowa, Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota and the District of Columbia also voted on Tuesday.
“The big story out of Pennsylvania is really voter confusion,” said Suzanne Almeida, interim director of government watchdog Common Cause Pennsylvania.
Some polling places in at least four Pennsylvania counties opened late, and some voting machines failed in at least three counties - Philadelphia, Bucks and Lancaster, according to the Pennsylvania Election Protection Coalition voting rights group.
Asked about reports of machine failures, Wanda Murren, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of State, said there were “really a very low number of voting machines with problems.” She did not provide a specific number.
In Indiana, voting rights groups said they heard from many people who reported they never received the absentee mail ballots they had requested.
“That certainly contributed to long lines in Marion County,” said Julia Vaughn, policy director for Common Cause Indiana. Marion County, which includes Indianapolis, consolidated its polling places and had only 22 open on Tuesday.

Emily Hodson, an elementary school teacher in Indianapolis, said she and her husband applied for their absentee ballots ahead of the deadline for requesting one and received confirmations they were on the way, but never received them.
“We had to go vote in person. We were a little nervous about it given COVID,” Hodson said.
The Indiana Secretary of State’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
Most in-person voting locations across the country featured extensive safety protocols - including masks, sanitizer and social distancing for lines.
The voting in some areas also was complicated by massive protests after an African-American man died in police custody in Minnesota last week. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said a city curfew would not be enforced until 30 minutes after polls close. In Washington, voters and poll workers were to be exempt from that city’s curfew, Mayor Muriel Bowser said.
Robert Wood, 54, said he considered not going to the polls given the dual threat of the coronavirus and riots. But the South Philadelphia resident said he thought last week’s events made it even more important.

“As a black man, I know a lot of people lost their lives so that I can vote. I take that seriously,” Wood said.
Counting the flood of mail-in ballots could delay the results, officials said. In Pennsylvania, Governor Tom Wolf extended the deadline for receiving mailed ballots postmarked by June 2 to June 9 in six counties, including Philadelphia.
The primaries came amid a partisan brawl over voting by mail, which Democrats support as a safe way to cast a ballot and Republican President Donald Trump condemns as ripe for fraud. Numerous studies have found little evidence of voting fraud tied to mail-in ballots.

643,"And the risk that failure by governments to limit the magnitude of climate change and adapt to it has risen to second place in the annual Global Risks Report in terms of both likelihood and impact, compared to only fifth place and fourth place in those categories last year in the survey.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-davos-meeting-climatechange/failure-to-curb-climate-change-a-top-risk-davos-survey-idUSKCN1PA13J,reuters,environment,center,33,1,Non-biased,No agreement,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The risk that global efforts to tackle climate change will fail has risen despite concerns about powerful storms, floods, and droughts, a survey released by the World Economic Forum said on Wednesday, days before its annual gathering in Davos.

The annual Global Risks Report, which incorporates the survey, highlighted several top risks for 2019 including massive incidents of data fraud and theft and large scale cyberattacks.
But the top risk by likelihood in the survey was extreme weather, in a survey of 1,000 experts from government, business, academia and non-governmental organizations. And the risk that failure by governments to limit the magnitude of climate change and adapt to it has risen to second place in terms of both likelihood and impact, compared to only fifth place and fourth place in those categories last year in the survey.
“Of all risks, it is in relation to the environment that the world is most clearly sleepwalking into catastrophe,” said the report.
After 200 countries, including the United States, agreed to tackle climate change in 2015 at U.N. talks in Paris, worries in the survey about governmental failure to tackle global warming fell.
But that has changed after U.S. President Donald Trump announced in 2017 his intention to pull out of the Paris agreement, a move he emphasized in 2018. In addition, deadly wildfires in Greece and California and hurricanes in Florida and North Carolina were frequently in the news.
“People ... are beginning to understand increasingly the gravity of the situation and that the Paris Agreement, even if fully implemented, cannot be seen as a panacea,” Aengus Collins, the report’s author and project leader told Reuters.
The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in October said global temperatures are likely to rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052 if global warming continues at its current pace and if the world fails to take rapid and unprecedented measures.
And U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide spiked 3.4 percent last year after falling for the previous three, the Rhodium Group, an independent research group, said last week.
Trump, who attended last year’s talks in Davos, plans to send Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to the talks that begin Jan. 22 as he grapples with Democrats over a partial government shutdown.
The report said rapidly growing coastal cities, particularly in Asia, are making people more vulnerable to climate change. A “vicious circle” of urbanization concentrates people and buildings in areas of potential damage, while also increasing risks, by destroying natural sources of resilience, such as mangrove forests, or increasing strain on groundwater reserves, it said.",['failure']
644,Lawmakers specifically said they want to protect women from facing unfair competition from men who claim to be transgender women.,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/D3lET1ZN_LM/,breitbart,sport,right,33,1,No agreement,No agreement,"Republican legislators in five states are drafting legislation to prevent men and women in high schools from participating in sports based on gender identity rather than their biological sex.
Lawmakers specifically said they want to protect women from facing unfair competition from men who claim to be transgender women.
The Wall Street Journal reported on the development:
The bills—introduced or prefiled in New Hampshire, Washington, Georgia, Tennessee and Missouri—reflect growing attention around the issue of whether transgender-rights protections are leading to unfair competition in women’s sports. Policies regulating the eligibility of transgender high-school athletes are usually set by school associations and vary. In about a third of states, transgender students can freely compete on teams of the gender they identify with, according to transathlete.com, which tracks athletics policies nationwide. Like the National Collegiate Athletic Association, some high-school associations allow transgender females to participate on girls’ teams if they meet certain conditions, such as completing a period of testosterone-suppression treatment or gender-reassignment surgery.
But several states do not have formal guidelines addressing this issue.
The Wall Street Journal reported that the bills apply to high school students, so they don’t conflict with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) guidelines, which allow transgender female athletes to compete on women’s college teams after completing a year of testosterone-suppression treatment.
The lawmakers cite advantages that males competing as transgender women have over biological females, including differences in muscle mass, bone strength, lung capacity, and heart size — all differences that cannot be changed by hormone therapy or surgery.
The Wall Street Journal reported:
Critics say the legislation is unnecessary and could raise constitutional concerns about due process and discrimination. Lawmakers interviewed said they couldn’t point to eligibility disputes in their own states, but cited examples elsewhere such as in Connecticut, where two transgender female high-schoolers recently dominated the state’s girls indoor track championships.
The Alliance Defending Freedom filed a complaint last year with the U.S. Department of Education on behalf of three female high school athletes challenging Connecticut’s transgender athletic policy.
“I’m just trying to maintain fairness,” said Rep. Bruce Griffey (R-TN), sponsor of a trans-athlete bill. “I don’t want girls to be at a disadvantage.”
Griffey’s bill would prevent public funding to schools that allow athletics participation based on students’ declared gender identity as opposed to a student’s biological sex at birth and would impose fines on school officials who don’t comply with the law.
The Wall Street Journal interviewed a “transgender attorney” with the American Civil Liberties Union about the trend. Chase Strangio said the laws would discourage transgender children from taking part in competitive sports.
“I think it will be the year of the trans-athletes bills in the way that 2016 was the year of the trans-bathroom bills,” Strangio said.
The Wall Street Journal reported on a bill in New Hampshire that says school-sponsored sports and teams designated for women “shall only be open to students of the female sex.”
“It states that a disqualified student can prove she is female by submitting a physician-signed statement attesting to the student’s reproductive anatomy, testosterone levels and sex chromosomes,” the Wall Street Journal reported.

659,"Mexico said on Monday it would reject a U.S. idea to take in all Central American asylum seekers if it is raised at talks this week with the Trump administration, which has threatened to impose tariffs if Mexico does not crack down on illegal immigration.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-mexico-deal/mexico-draws-red-line-on-asylum-as-trump-tariff-risk-rises-idUSKCN1T41KU?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews,reuters,immigration,center,33,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico said on Monday it would reject a U.S. idea to take in all Central American asylum seekers if it is raised at talks this week with the Trump administration, which has threatened to impose tariffs if Mexico does not crack down on illegal immigration.
President Donald Trump said last week he would impose a blanket tariff on Mexican imports on June 10 to try to pressure Mexico to tackle large flows of mostly Central American migrants passing through en route to the United States. The move has spooked global markets worried about a new front in the U.S. trade war.
Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said the country was committed to continuing to work to keep migrants from Central America from reaching the U.S. border. Pushing back against Trump’s charge that Mexico was doing “nothing” to help, the government said 250,000 more immigrants would reach the United States in 2019 without its efforts.
Ebrard said, however, that a proposal favored by some U.S. officials to designate Mexico a “safe third country,” which would force Central Americans seeking asylum in the United States to apply for it instead in Mexico, was not an option.
“An agreement about a safe third country would not be acceptable for Mexico,” Ebrard told reporters in Washington. “They have not yet proposed it to me. But it would not be acceptable and they know it.”
Such a designation would in theory cut the number of new Central American asylum seekers to almost zero, and removing it from the discussion leaves fewer negotiating options available for avoiding the 5% tariffs due to kick in next week.
The Mexican economy, which is heavily reliant on exports to the United States, shrank in the first quarter and would reel under U.S. levies.
Goldman Sachs economists on Monday gave a 70% chance of the tariffs on Mexican imports coming into effect on June 10.
Trump’s threat roiled markets already hit by the trade war between the United States and China. The price of oil fell on Monday as U.S. disputes with the two countries deepened concerns about weakening global crude demand.
Markets are concerned that import tariffs would ultimately hit the U.S. economy by adding to the cost of a wide range of goods in the United States, from Mexican-made cars and auto parts to televisions, beer and food.
Mexican Economy Minister Graciela Marquez said in a statement such duties would affect all 50 U.S. states and harm value chains, consumers and trade-related jobs in both countries.
She said Mexico would retaliate if the tariffs were imposed, either hitting back at targeted U.S. goods, or by seeking redress through multilateral organizations.
In the recent past, Mexico has been effective in focusing trade retaliation on U.S. agricultural produce in states that voted for Trump in the 2016 election.
A 5% tariff on imported goods from Mexico, which last year totaled $347 billion, according to U.S. data, would result in a potential tax increase on American businesses and consumers of $17 billion, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimated. It said the number would reach $86 billion should Trump’s increase the duties to 25%, as threatened.
The Chamber has said it is looking at ways to challenge Trump’s plan, including legal options.
U.S. PRIORITIES?
In a possible sign of U.S. priorities in the talks, which are due to run through at least Wednesday, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said on Sunday that Mexico should deploy more personnel to stop migrants along a remote stretch of border with Guatemala.
McAleenan also said Mexico should bolster its own screenings along that border, crack down on criminal networks transporting migrants and enable more to wait in Mexico while they apply for asylum in the United States.

Since January, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s government has rapidly ramped up detentions and deportations, but that has not been enough to stop the growing tide of families reaching the United States, mainly from Guatemala and Honduras. Many of them are trying to escape poverty and violent crime.
Trump and fellow Republicans say something needs to be done to stem the biggest migrant surge on the border in a decade.
U.S. officials say 80,000 people are being held in custody, and the more than 100,000 migrants who arrived in April are overwhelming Border Patrol officials.
In its biggest concession to Trump so far, Mexico agreed in December to receive some Central Americans seeking asylum in the United States to await the resolution of their cases.
So far, 8,835 people have been sent into Mexico under the program, commonly known as “Remain in Mexico.”
During a visit to Britain on Monday, Trump returned to the subject on Twitter.
“As a sign of good faith, Mexico should immediately stop the flow of people and drugs through their country and to our Southern Border. They can do it if they want!” he wrote.
Mexican officials in Washington warned on Monday that the tariffs could backfire, fanning further migration by hammering regional economies.
“Tariffs, along with the decision to cancel aid programs to the northern Central American countries, could have a counterproductive effect and would not reduce migration flows,” Mexico’s ambassador to the United States, Martha Barcena, told a news conference.
Approval of a deal to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement among Mexico, the United States and Canada could be hampered by the latest dispute over immigration, said Jesus Seade, Mexico’s deputy foreign minister for North America.

The air quality index of the state-run Central Pollution Control Board showing the concentration of poisonous particulate matter known as PM 2.5 stood at 440, up from 430 on Wednesday, and about 12 times the U.S. government recommended level of 35.
Pollution levels hit 500 in some parts of New Delhi, with very poor visibility in some areas. Last year, the high was 450 on Dec. 23.
“Climatic conditions have contributed to the crisis, but let’s admit that most steps announced in 2018 have failed miserably,” said Sunil Dahiya, a senior campaigner with environmental group Greenpeace.
A sharp drop in temperatures and wind speed, combined with vehicle and industrial emissions, dust from building sites and smoke from garbage burning has boosted pollution over much of north India, including New Delhi, home to more than 20 million.
A spokesman for the federal government was not immediately available to comment. The city government refused to comment.
Both the federal government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Arvind Kejriwal’s Delhi government have not announced any measures to fight pollution this year.
Cold weather has forced some people, especially those spending the night in the open, to burn small fires to keep warm, adding to the smog.
Unfavorable weather conditions have worsened the crisis, but government measures have also failed to improve air quality in New Delhi and elsewhere.
As pollution spiked in the city in October and November, the government adopted measures ranging from a temporary ban on construction activities and garbage burning to a clampdown on polluting industrial plants, such as coal-fired power stations.
Critics say the measures were inadequate and poorly implemented, largely because of a lack of resources and political will to fight the toxic air, which has driven a spurt in patients battling pollution-related health issues.
India is home to the world’s 14 most polluted cities, with Delhi the sixth worst, the World Health Organization said in a report this year.
Toxic air claimed 1.24 million lives in India last year, or 12.5 percent of total deaths, a study published in Lancet Planetary Health showed this month.
“India cuts a sorry figure because of the reports from international bodies,” said Dahiya. “If a country fails to give clean air to its people, agencies like the WHO and Lancet will talk about it.”",[]

On Tuesday, Governor Roy Cooper rejected Republican demands to guarantee that attendance at the convention in Charlotte would not be restricted by social-distancing measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus.
In response, Trump said on Twitter that the party would relocate the event.
The Republican National Committee said in a statement that “the celebration of the president’s acceptance of the Republican nomination will be held in another city” because of Cooper’s decision. Trump is seeking a second term in the Nov. 3 election.
Should the governor later change the restrictions to allow more people to gather, “we still hope to conduct the official business of the convention in Charlotte,” the statement said.
Republican officials were considering whether to have Trump formally accept the nomination and deliver his acceptance speech in Jacksonville, Florida; Orlando, Florida; Nashville, Tennessee; New Orleans, Dallas or Phoenix, one official said.
“We are working to schedule visits to these cities by Republican National Committee officials in the coming days,” the official said.
Earlier, the official said the states being considered were Florida, Georgia, Tennessee or Arizona.
North Carolina previously lifted some restrictions applied to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but remains in Phase 2 of a reopening plan, which limits indoor gatherings to no more than 10 people.
Cooper, referring to the Republicans, said on Twitter on Tuesday night: “It’s unfortunate they never agreed to scale down and make changes to keep people safe.”

A one-page order issued by Justice Samuel Alito said that “the justices need time to review” the various court filings before making a decision on the emergency application filed by Shreveport-based abortion provider Hope Medical Group for Women to block the law.
Alito said that the restrictions, which were to go into effect on Monday, will be put on hold until at least Feb. 7.
Hope Medical Group challenged the law’s requirement that doctors who perform abortions must have a difficult-to-obtain formal relationship called “admitting privileges” at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of where the procedure would be performed.
Lawyers for the Center for Reproductive Rights, an abortion rights group that represents the challengers, said the law could force the closure of two of the three abortion clinics operating in Louisiana, a state of more than 4.6 million people.
The Republican-backed law was passed in 2014 but courts have prevented it from taking effect. The Supreme Court itself blocked it in 2016, two days after hearing another major case involving a similar Texas measure that the justices eventually struck down.
Kennedy, a conservative who retired in July 2018, had voted to preserve abortion rights in important 1992 and 2016 rulings. Republican President Donald Trump replaced Kennedy with Brett Kavanaugh, one of two Trump appointees who are part of the court’s 5-4 conservative majority, along with Neil Gorsuch.
Lawyers for the abortion provider said the Louisiana provision is almost identical to the Texas law the Supreme Court struck down in 2016 on a 5-3 vote, with Kennedy joining the court’s four liberals in the majority. As a result, the court’s action in the Louisiana case could send a signal on whether the new conservative majority will retreat from the 2016 ruling.
A federal district judge struck down Louisiana’s law in January 2016, saying it created an undue burden on a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion under existing Supreme Court precedent. The high court legalized abortion nationwide in 1973.
But in a September 2018 ruling, the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived the law, saying there was no evidence any clinics in Louisiana would close as a result of the “admitting privileges” requirement.
The 5th Circuit on Jan. 18 refused on a 9-6 vote to rehear the case, prompting four of its judges to dissent, saying the court’s September ruling was “in clear conflict” with the Supreme Court’s Texas decision.

Speaking in Philadelphia – a city rocked by sometimes violent demonstrations in recent days – the former vice president sought to draw a vivid contrast between himself and Trump, whom he will face in the Nov. 3 general election.
Biden, who served eight years as vice president under Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, cast himself as the candidate who best understands the longstanding pain and grief in the country’s black communities.
He said the killing of George Floyd, the African-American man who died at the hands of Minneapolis police last week, was a “wake-up call” for the nation that must force it to address the stain of systemic racism.
“We can’t leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away and do nothing,” Biden said. “We can’t.”
He accused Trump, a Republican, of turning the nation into “a battlefield riven by old resentments and fresh fears.”
“Is this who we want to be?” he asked. “Is this what we want to pass on to our children and grandchildren? Fear, anger, finger pointing, rather than the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety, self-absorption, selfishness?”
Biden was particularly critical of Trump’s visit on Monday to a historic church across from the White House, which was preceded by law enforcement authorities dispersing a crowd near the church with smoke canisters and flash grenades.
“We can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,” said Biden, who accused Trump of “serving the passions” of his conservative base at the expense of the rest of the country.

Biden pledged he would “not traffic in fear or division.”
Biden, 77, has been under pressure from young African-Americans and other progressives to aggressively address racial and economic inequities in the country - and he has been increasingly talking in terms of sweeping societal change.
His long history in the Senate, where he authored a now-heavily criticized crime bill in the 1990s, has at times complicated that effort, sowing some mistrust among activists.
At the same time, he has been mindful of condemning the looting and violence that has marked some of the protests.
Trump campaign senior adviser Katrina Pierson accused Biden in a statement after the speech of making “the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.”
Trump on Monday called the violence at the protests “acts of domestic terror” and threatened to deploy the U.S. military to secure the nation’s cities.
Biden’s speech on Tuesday at Philadelphia’s City Hall marked the first time he has left his home state of Delaware since mid-March, when the outbreak of the novel coronavirus forced him to halt in-person campaigning.
While Biden had made public appearances in Delaware in recent days and convened a virtual conference of big-city mayors on Monday, Tuesday’s speech suggested he may soon begin to again move about the country as states slowly re-open.
Biden formally launched his White House bid in Philadelphia last year, and it’s where his campaign headquarters - currently empty because of the pandemic - is located.

The rulings came in a series of legal actions aimed at blocking steps by various Republican-led states cracking down on abortion during the pandemic.
The first of the decisions involved Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s announcement last week that abortion providers were covered by a state order that required postponement of non-urgent medical procedures to preserve hospital beds and equipment during the pandemic.
U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel in Austin ruled that Paxton’s action “prevents Texas women from exercising what the Supreme Court has declared is their fundamental constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy before a fetus is viable.”
The Texas lawsuit was filed last Wednesday after clinics said they were forced to cancel hundreds of appointments for abortions across the state.
“Abortion is essential healthcare, and it’s a time-sensitive service, especially during a public health crisis,” said Amy Hagstrom Miller, president of Whole Woman’s Health, an abortion provider with three clinics in Texas and a plaintiff in the case.
“To the politicians who used this global pandemic to push their anti-abortion agenda, shame on you,” she added.
Marc Rylander, a spokesman for Paxton, expressed disappointment in the ruling and promised an appeal.
Abortion providers in Ohio, Iowa, Alabama and Oklahoma filed similar litigation on Monday to block state officials from using coronavirus-related orders to limit abortion availability.
Judges in Ohio and Alabama issued orders later on Monday blocking the states from enforcing the coronavirus-related restrictions against abortion providers.
Courts were working on an urgent basis as clinics warned that some patients were reaching the legal time limit to get the procedure.
Abortion providers have said the restrictions violate the right to abortion under the U.S. Constitution as recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.
The states have said they have broad powers to issue emergency rules to protect the health and safety of their residents. Texas said in a court filing: “Individual rights, including abortion, may be temporarily curtailed in a time of emergency.”
Paxton said on March 23 the state order meant that any abortion that “is not medically necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother” must cease. Failure to comply could result in penalties of up to $1,000 or 180 days in jail.
Abortion rights advocates have criticized the state actions as political opportunism during the pandemic.
“It’s not surprising that the states that are now using the COVID crisis to stop people from getting abortion care are the very same states that have history of passing laws to ban abortion or using sham rationales to shut down clinics,” said American Civil Liberties Union attorney Jennifer Dalven.
COVID-19 is the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.

In Ohio, the abortion clinics told U.S. District Judge Michael Barrett in Cincinnati that they feared being immediately shut down and prosecuted if they did not stop providing surgical abortions.
“Some of these patients will be forced to carry pregnancies to term against their will and at risk to their health amidst a health system overburdened by responding to COVID-19,” the clinics said in a legal filing.",[]

The same official said Iranian hackers had recently targeted email accounts belonging to Republican President Donald Trump’s campaign staff.

The announcement, made on Twitter by the head of Google’s Threat Analysis Group, Shane Huntley, is the latest indication of the digital spying routinely aimed at top politicians.
Huntley said there was “no sign of compromise” of either campaign.
Iranian attempts to break into Trump campaign officials’ emails have been documented before. Last year, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) announced that a group often nicknamed Charming Kitten had tried to break into email accounts belonging to an unnamed U.S. presidential campaign, which sources identified as Trump’s.
Earlier this year, the threat intelligence company Area 1 Security said Russian hackers had targeted companies tied to a Ukrainian gas firm where Biden’s son once served on the board.
Google declined to offer details beyond Huntley’s tweets, but the unusually public attribution is a sign of how sensitive Americans have become to digital espionage efforts aimed at political campaigns.
“We sent the targeted users our standard government-backed attack warning and we referred this information to federal law enforcement,” a Google representative said.
Hacking to interfere in elections has become a concern for governments, especially since U.S intelligence agencies concluded that Russia ran a hacking and propaganda operation to disrupt the American democratic process in 2016 to help then-candidate Trump become president. Among the targets was digital infrastructure used by 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign here
Moscow has denied any meddling.
Attempts by foreign adversaries to break into presidential campaigns are commonplace but the unusually public attribution offered by Google is a sign of how sensitive Americans have become to digital espionage efforts aimed at candidates.
“We are aware of reports from Google that a foreign actor has made unsuccessful attempts to access the personal email accounts of campaign staff,” a Biden campaign spokesman said. “We have known from the beginning of our campaign that we would be subject to such attacks and we are prepared for them.”
The Trump campaign, the Chinese Embassy in Washington and the Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Charming Kitten, the group identified by Google as being responsible for the targeting of the Trump campaign, has also recently hit the headlines over other exploits, including the targeting of the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O).
Earlier this year, Reuters tied the group to attempts to impersonate high-profile media figures and journalists.
John Hultquist, senior director of intelligence analysis with U.S. cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc (FEYE.O), described the two hacking groups as “espionage actors” and said they were likely attempting to collect intelligence rather than steal material to leak online.
The FBI and Office of the Director of National Intelligence both declined to comment.","['espionage', 'sensitive']"

Only 46% of Americans who identify as Republicans say the country is on the right track, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted last week. It is the first time that number has fallen so low since August 2017, when a rally organized by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia led to violent clashes with counter-protesters.
As recently as early March, before the novel coronavirus forced widespread shutdowns across the country, about 70% of Republicans said they were optimistic about the country’s direction.
Trump’s approval rating remains resilient at around 40%, with a large majority of Republicans still approving of his overall performance.
But sustained pessimism among Trump’s supporters could portend potential weakness ahead of November’s election, when he will face Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden, experts said.
Thirty-seven percent of Republicans said the country is on the wrong track; 17% of those said they would vote for Biden if the election were held now, while 63% still plan to cast ballots for Trump.
In an election most analysts believe will come down to a handful of closely divided states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, even minor defections or a dip in turnout among the Republican ranks could imperil Trump’s chances.
“It probably should be concerning for the president, even though it’s reasonable to say he still maintains strong support among Republicans,” said Kyle Kondik, an elections analyst at the University of Virginia.
Republicans believe an economic rebound in the fall would bolster his prospects. Friday’s jobs report showed more than 2.5 million jobs were added last month during the thick of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump touted the gains as the “greatest comeback in American history.”
Trump campaign spokeswoman Erin Perrine said in a statement, “Polling is notoriously wrong. We are five months from the election and any polling now is not a clear indicator of election results. Pollsters were very wrong in 2016 and underestimate voters’ enthusiasm for President Trump every time.”
‘THINGS ARE DEFINITELY WRONG’
The pessimism among all Americans has grown since the end of February, when the pandemic began accelerating. But unlike Republicans, large majorities of Democrats and independents already felt the country was on the wrong track; fewer than 7 percent of Democrats and 19 percent of independents feel the country is headed in the right direction, down slightly from March, the poll showed.
Matthew Knight, a 48-year-old resident in North Carolina who supported Trump in 2016, said he has been disappointed with Trump’s response to the crises.
“Just think with everything going on, and Trump not helping matters, that things are definitely wrong,” Knight wrote in an email to Reuters. “I was going to vote for Trump, but if things don’t get better, I may have to rethink that.”
Reuters conducted interviews and email exchanges with more than a dozen Republicans who said the country was headed in the wrong direction, yielding a mix of responses.
Some, such as Bill McMichael, a 62-year-old in politically divided Minnesota who hasn’t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in four decades, are considering voting for Biden out of disgust with Trump.
A few admitted some misgivings but still plan to vote for Trump, either because they are more skeptical about Biden or trust Trump to revive the economy. Others blamed Democrats for the country’s problems.
“The last week sure shows you the direction the liberals are trying to drive this country,” said Ken Wilamowski, 68, a retired General Motors engineer in Clarkston, Michigan, adding that Democratic governors have been too unwilling to confront protesters. “Pacifism is going to lose to anarchy every time.”
Trump has urged governors to “dominate” the streets and claimed that far-left radicals are primarily responsible for the violence. Protesters again gathered in Washington for a big demonstration on Saturday.
“In normal political circumstances, having a 40% favorability would be terrible, but that’s just not the world we live in right now,” said Terry Sullivan, a Republican strategist who served as Senator Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign manager in 2016. “The numbers really haven’t moved in the last 3-1/2 years.”
Tom Singer, a 57-year-old probation officer in Riverside, California, said Trump’s presidency has been “dysfunctional.” Nevertheless, he said he would still likely vote for him in November because he trusts Trump will deliver where it matters most: on the economy.
“I’m not happy with either candidate, but I have to look at the one who’s going to have the greatest impact on me,” he said.

816,"The oil price crash has led to Danish offshore wind developer Orsted overtaking Norwegian oil major Equinor as the most valuable energy company in the Nordics, highlighting the appeal to investors of renewables over fossil fuels.",https://www.reuters.com/article/climatechange-stocks-equinor-orsted/oil-crash-makes-danish-wind-power-firm-the-nordics-biggest-energy-company-idUSL8N2B32RM,reuters,environment,center,41,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"COPENHAGEN/OSLO, March 10 (Reuters) - The oil price crash has led to Danish offshore wind developer Orsted overtaking Norwegian oil major Equinor as the most valuable energy company in the Nordics, highlighting the appeal to investors of renewables over fossil fuels.
Shares in Equinor slid nearly 18% on Monday as crude prices plunged 25% after top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia began a price war that threatens to swamp global oil markets with supply.
At around 0900 GMT on Tuesday, Equinor’s market value stood at $42 billion, while Orsted was valued at $45 billion, according to share information on the companies’ websites, the first time Orsted has overtaken the Norwegian company.
The drop in oil prices on Monday was the biggest one-day percentage drop since Jan. 17, 1991 at the outset of the first Gulf War and for investors highlighted the risk of investing in oil companies. As well as volatile crude prices, oil producers have also been hit by a global shift away from heavily polluting fossil fuels.
Orsted, formerly named DONG Energy, has seen its shares gain more than 40% over the past year, while shares in Equinor have fallen by around the same margin.
Orsted has been rebranding itself as a ‘renewable major’ after it sold its oil and gas business in 2017, courting investors interested in green investments which have seen a boost thanks to policies to protect the environment.
“All investors look at Orsted and say: Here we buy into the future and when they look at the oil companies including Equinor they buy into the past,” said head of equity research at Sydbank Jacob Pedersen.
Equinor has made some steps towards building a renewable business and plans to spend up to $2 billion-$3 billion a year in 2022-2023 on renewable projects, out of a total capital spending of $12 billion.
Teodor Sveen-Nilsen at Oslo-based Sparebank 1 Markets said the change in market valuation showed green investments gaining momentum over the past few days. However, low oil prices posed risks for renewables in the longer term.
“Low oil prices are bad for renewable companies, because the cost of energy comes down and there are less incentives to invest in alternative energy sources. Also, low oil prices would encourage demand growth,” he said in an e-mail to Reuters.
Both Orsted and Equinor declined to comment when asked by Reuters.
Equinor shares steadied on Tuesday, rising around 5% in morning trade, as did shares in Orsted, which fell 4.6% on Monday as global equity markets fell across the board. They were up 2.6% on Tuesday.

Yet the obvious data points don’t capture a number of the socio-economic developments - from a soaring number of opioid overdose deaths to record levels of student debt to what and where today’s jobs are. These developments are subtle but they are profoundly shaping the economy and the discourse about it, as the ‘20s come into view.
GRAPHIC: A workforce scarred - here
OPIOIDS AND THE WORK FORCE
The number of overdose deaths involving opioids doubled in the 2010s and appears to have hit a peak in 2017 at 47,600, which accounted for 68% of all fatal drug overdoses that year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On top of that, more than 10 million Americans over the age of 12 were found to have misused opioids in 2018, the last year figures were available from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.
Long recognized as a nationwide health and social crisis, the opioid epidemic has become a growing focus for economists concerned it may be one of the factors behind the decade’s slump in labor force participation among prime-age workers 25-54 years old. While improving since late 2015, participation remains below levels seen in the 1990s.
GRAPHIC: The rich got (a lot) richer - here
THE WEALTH GAP
A soaring stock market and strong job growth have helped make Americans on the whole wealthier than ever, with total household net worth topping $107 trillion versus less than $60 trillion at the dawn of the decade.
But those gains have not be shared evenly. The richest 1% of households account for 32.4% of all wealth, up roughly 4 percentage points from the end of 2009.
The phenomenon is feeding the national political debate, and some Democratic presidential contenders are now pushing for a national wealth tax.
GRAPHIC: Job growth concentrated in a handful of cities - here
THE LUCKY FEW
Just as wealth is increasingly harnessed by a few, job opportunities are also concentrated in a handful of places around the country.
Between 2010 and 2017, 40% of all new jobs were created in just 20 cities, with places like Nashville and Portland, Oregon, punching significantly above their relative population weight.
GRAPHIC: Winners keep winning - here
THE INNOVATION ELITES
What’s more, an even smaller clutch of five cities - four on the West Coast and one in the East - are gaining effectively all of the new jobs in so-called “innovation” industries seen as essential to future economic success.
GRAPHIC: Jobs of the 2010s - here
HEALTH AND FITNESS
What Americans do for a living has changed a lot in the last 10 years.
Many old-school industries saw minimal job growth, like manufacturing, or extended declines, like department stores.
The evolving needs of an increasingly technology-oriented economy drove rapid growth in many IT jobs, while an aging population was behind a surge in the number of home health workers. Americans’ changing spending habits - increasingly on experiences over things - helped make fitness center jobs among the fastest growing of the decade.
GRAPHIC: American dream comes later and later - here
DELAYING THE DREAM
Buying their first home used to be a milestone that many Americans achieved by the time they were 30.
But a shortage of homes for sale is driving up prices and making it harder for younger consumers to break into the market, said Jessica Lautz, vice president of demographics and behavioral insights at the National Association of Realtors.
Student debt loads are also making it more difficult for some borrowers to set aside sufficient cash for a down payment, or to qualify for a mortgage, she said. That helps to explain why the median age of the first-time home buyer ticked up to 33 in 2019 from 30 in 2010, according to the association.

PAYING OFF COLLEGE
In fact, no category of consumer debt grew as fast in the 2010s as student loans, and serious delinquency rates are more than 10 times higher than for mortgages.
Total balances owed to pay for higher education more than doubled since 2009 to around $1.5 trillion today - equal to nearly 8% of annual U.S. economic output. Nearly 11% of the total outstanding is 90 days or more behind in payments.

FILE PHOTO: ICE detainees are seen at the Adelanto immigration detention center, which is run by the Geo Group Inc (GEO.N), in Adelanto, California, U.S., April 13, 2017. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo
He could content himself with a jailhouse diet that he said left him perpetually hungry. Or he could labor in the prison’s kitchen to earn money to buy extra food at the commissary.
Cruz went to work. But his $1-a-day salary at the privately run Adelanto Detention Facility did not stretch far.
A can of commissary tuna sold for $3.25. That is more than four times the price at a Target store near the small desert town of Adelanto, about two hours northeast of Los Angeles. Cruz stuck with ramen noodles at 58 cents a package, double the Target price. A miniature deodorant stick, at $3.35 and more than three days’ wages, was an impossible luxury, he said.
“If I bought that there wouldn’t be enough money for food,” Cruz said.
Tuna and deodorant would seem minor worries for detainees such as Cruz. Now 25, he sought asylum after fleeing gangs trying to recruit him in his native Honduras, a place where saying “no” can mean execution.
But immigration attorneys say the pricey commissary goods are part of a broader strategy by private prisons to harness cheap inmate labor to lower operating costs and boost profits.
Immigrants and activists say facilities such as Adelanto, owned by Boca Raton, Fla.-based Geo Group Inc (GEO.N), the nation’s largest for-profit corrections company, deliberately skimp on essentials, even food, to coerce detainees to labor for pennies an hour to supplement meager rations.
Geo Group spokesperson Pablo Paez called those allegations “completely false.” He said detainees are given meals approved by dieticians, the labor program is strictly voluntary, and wage rates are federally mandated.
The company said Geo Group contracts with outside vendors to run its commissaries, whose prices “are in line with comparable local markets.” It also said Geo Group makes a “minimal commission” on commissary items, most of which goes into a “welfare fund” to purchase recreational equipment and other items for detainees.
Relatives can send money electronically to fund their loved ones’ commissary accounts, for fees that can reach as high as 10 percent of the amount deposited, some families report. But for many immigrant detainees, scrubbing toilets or mopping floors is the only way they say they can earn enough to stay clean and fed.
You “either work for a few cents an hour or live without basic things like soap, shampoo, deodorant and food,” detainee Wilhen Hill Barrientos, 67, said in a class-action lawsuit filed last year by the Southern Poverty Law Center against Nashville-based CoreCivic Inc (CXW.N), the nation’s second-largest for-profit prison operator. In the complaint, Barrientos said guards told him to “use his fingers” when he asked for toilet paper at the Stewart Detention Center, located in rural Lumpkin, Georgia.
Detainees are challenging what they say is an oppressive business model in which the companies deprive them of essentials to force them to work for sub-minimum wages, money that is soon recaptured in the firms’ own commissaries.
“These private prison companies are profiting off of what is essentially a company-store scenario,” said the SPLC’s Meredith Stewart, a lead attorney on the class action.
Immigrant rights groups have filed similar lawsuits against CoreCivic and Geo Group in California, Colorado, Texas and Washington.
Government watchdogs and lawmakers are taking notice too.
In November, 11 U.S. senators, including 2020 presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, sent letters to Geo Group and CoreCivic lambasting the “perverse profit incentive at the core of the private prison business,” which has benefited from a crackdown on illegal immigrants under U.S. President Donald Trump.
The senators cited a December 2017 report from the U.S. Office of the Inspector General documenting problems at lockups contracted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The inspector general found spoiled, moldy and expired food, and cited detainees’ complaints that hygiene products were “not provided promptly or at all,” the report said.
The lawmakers have demanded Geo Group and CoreCivic respond to allegations of detainee mistreatment.
Geo Group said a comprehensive, detailed response is underway. The company told Reuters that Geo Group has “already taken steps to remedy areas where our processes fell short of our commitment to high-quality care.”
CoreCivic spokeswoman Amanda Gilchrist said the company disagrees with the senators’ assertions, and that it provides “all daily needs” of detainees.
She said CoreCivic follows all federal standards for ICE-contracted facilities, including management of the outside vendors that run its commissaries, prices for commissary products, and fees charged to families for depositing funds into detainees’ commissary accounts.
BULL MARKET IN IMMIGRANT DETENTION
The U.S. for-profit prison industry has exploded over the past two decades. In 2016, 128,300 people - roughly 1 in 12 U.S. prisoners - were incarcerated in private lock-ups. That is an increase of 47 percent from 2000, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
Geo Group and CoreCivic together manage over half of U.S. private prison contracts, with combined revenues of nearly $4 billion in 2017. ICE is the No. 1 customer by revenue for both companies.
Trump’s immigration polices have been a boon for the industry, which spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on his election and inauguration. In fiscal 2019, the number of people in ICE detention has averaged 45,200 daily, according to agency spokesman Vincent Picard. That is up nearly 19 percent from fiscal 2017.
Both Geo Group and CoreCivic have added hundreds of immigration detention beds over the past year. Stock prices for the two companies are up about 30 percent since Trump’s election.
The government pays private prison companies fees ranging from roughly $60 to $130 daily for the care and feeding of each detainee.
At CoreCivic’s Stewart Detention Center in Georgia, which houses about 1,700 undocumented immigrants, ICE pays a per diem of $62.03 for each detainee housed there. CoreCivic’s revenue from Stewart alone was $38 million last year, court records show.
Detainee Barrientos, the lead lawsuit plaintiff, said in court documents he worked 7 days a week at the facility in order to purchase hygiene products and phone cards to call family members in Guatemala.
Those basics can add up. Reuters viewed a copy of the center’s commissary price list. It shows detainees are charged $11.02 for a 4 oz. tube of Sensodyne toothpaste, available on Amazon.com for $5.20.
Dove soap priced at $2.44 at the commissary is available for just over a dollar at Target. A 2.5 oz tube of Effergrip denture cream that sells for $4.99 at Walmart is $7.12 at the commissary.
Fees are pricey too. Vioney Gutierrez, a former detainee at Geo Group’s Adelanto facility in California, said 10 percent of the money her family spent to fund her commissary account was consumed by fees.
“When my daughter put in $40, I got $36,” said Gutierrez, 37. A native of Mexico, she said she spent six months at Adelanto in 2018 after asking for asylum at a port of entry. She is currently out on bond and staying with family in Oregon while she awaits the outcome of her deportation case.
Geo Group said its inmate commissary account services are provided by a third-party vendor, and that it does not profit from those transactions.
At Adelanto, Gutierrez said it cost $1 a minute to make calls to Mexico, and even more to places further afield, prices that keep many detainees from communicating with their families.
Geo Group said ICE contracts with a third-party telecom vendor and that the company plays “no role whatsoever in communications services.”

High commissary prices have long been a complaint of prison reformers. But for immigrant detainees, many of whom borrowed money or drained savings to reach the United States, the prices are particularly prohibitive.
Cruz, the Honduran detainee, spent eight months at Adelanto last year before an immigrant rights organization paid the $10,000 bond for his release. He is now in Texas awaiting the outcome of his case.
In his final months at Adelanto, Cruz said he resorted to bartering, trading shoes he wove out of plastic bags for ramen and cookies.",['execution']

The Senegalese was subjected to insults and monkey chants during the match against Inter Milan at San Siro on Boxing Day and was sent off for dissent late in the game with Napoli coach Carlo Ancelotti blaming his loss of temper on the atmosphere in the stadium.
There was confusion over how the incident should have been handled on the pitch as Ancelotti said Napoli officials unsuccessfully asked three times for the match to be stopped.
FIFA and European soccer body UEFA have adopted a so-called three-step procedure in cases of racism which involves a warning to the crowd, followed by the interruption of play and, ultimately, the calling-off of the match.
However, last week, Italy’s Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said he was against the idea of stopping games, saying it would put Italian football on a “slippery slope.”
“I respect the minister’s ideas but the FIGC should follow the procedures of FIFA and UEFA,” said Gravina. “In the next meeting of the executive committee we will simplify the process for stopping matches.”
“Following a stadium announcement, the match will be temporarily suspended and the teams will go to the center of the pitch. If the chanting continues, they will go to the dressing room. At that point, the public security officials will decide if the match is re-started or called off.”
Under Italian rules introduced in 2013, it is up to the match referee to alert the fourth official to racism, however Gravina said that job should be done by federation officials.
“The referee should referee the match,” said Gravina. “It’s unthinkable that he should be responsible for sending home 50,000 people.”
Inter were ordered to play their next two home games behind closed doors while Koulibaly was banned for two matches for his sending-off, sparking criticism that the victim was being punished.",[]

FILE PHOTO: A sign is pictured at the entrance to a Planned Parenthood building in New York August 31, 2015. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson
In an 11-6 vote, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati overturned a ruling last year by a three-judge panel of the court that the funding ban violated the due process rights of Planned Parenthood affiliates.
“The affiliates are correct that the Ohio law imposes a condition on the continued receipt of state funds,” Circuit Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote for the majority. “But that condition does not violate the Constitution because the affiliates do not have a due process right to perform abortions.”
Sutton also found no proof the ban posed an undue burden on a woman’s right to abortion, a right he said belonged to women, not to Planned Parenthood.
Tuesday’s decision voided a lower court injunction against enforcing the 2016 law, which had been signed by then-Republican Governor John Kasich. The appeals court upheld the injunction last April 18.
RESTRICTING SERVICES
Planned Parenthood said the law strips funding that helps it test for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, conduct cancer screenings, and offer programs to reduce infant mortality and address domestic violence.
“It is unconscionable that politicians continue seeking to restrict people from accessing essential health care - which is a human right,” Chief Executive Leana Wen said in a statement.
Planned Parenthood did not say whether it might appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Ohio’s defense of the law was long led by then-Republican Attorney General Mike DeWine, who is now governor.
“Governor DeWine is pleased by today’s decision as he has long believed that the people of Ohio, through its state legislature, have the right to decide what it funds and what it doesn’t fund,” spokesman Dan Tierney said.
The Ohio law is one of many in recent years from Republican-led states to restrict abortion providers, as President Donald Trump appoints more conservatives to the federal bench.
All 11 judges in Tuesday’s majority are Republican appointees, including four named by Trump, while five of the six dissenting judges were appointed by Democratic presidents.
Eric Murphy, who argued Ohio’s original appeal for ending funding, won U.S. Senate approval this month to join the appeals court after being appointed by Trump.
CRYING UNCLE
The Ohio law targeted nearly $1.5 million of annual Planned Parenthood funding from the state health department.
It required the department to ensure that funds it received through six non-abortion-related federal programs were not used to fund providers of non-therapeutic abortions.
Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio said it runs 19 centers, most of which do not perform abortions.
Circuit Judge Helene White, who wrote the April 2018 ruling, in a dissenting opinion accused the majority of trying to force Planned Parenthood to “cry uncle” and lose funding as a condition of performing abortions.
“The Constitution prohibits unduly burdening a woman’s abortion right, even in the form of laws that directly target only the gatekeeper to a woman’s abortion right - the provider,” White wrote.
The case is Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio et al v Hodges, 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 16-4027.",['depriving']

Phoenix’s Oscar speech for Joker was a rambling discourse that veered in several direction before settling on environmental platitudes.
“I think, whether we’re talking about gender inequality or racism or queer rights or indigenous rights or animal rights, we’re talking about the fight against injustice,” he said. “We’re talking about the fight against the belief that one nation, one people, one race, one gender or one species has the right to dominate, control and use and exploit another with impunity.”
The actor then bore down on animal rights, specifically the life cycle of a cow.
“I think that we’ve become very disconnected from the natural world, and many of us, what we’re guilty of is an egocentric worldview — the belief that we’re the center of the universe,” he said.
“We go into the natural world, and we plunder it for its resources. We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow, and when she gives birth, we steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakable. Then, we take her milk, that’s intended for her calf, and we put it in our coffee and our cereal, and I think we fear the idea of personal change because we think that we have to sacrifice something to give something up.”
Lena Dunham has publicly chronicled her weight struggles due to endometriosis and a romantic breakup. The Girls and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood star has posted scantily-clad images of herself on social media, including a photo last year of herself in lingerie to celebrate her weight gain and “big, generous, jiggly happiness.”

The United States has been seeking to limit the role of Chinese telecom equipment makers such as Huawei Technologies in building 5G networks due to fears they could be used by Beijing for spying. Huawei has denied the allegations.
Officials say they hope to conclude the meeting — attended by representatives from 30 European Union, NATO and countries such as the United States, Germany, Japan and Australia — with an outline of practices that could form a basis for a coordinated approach to shared security and policy measures.
Russia, China and Huawei were not invited, although a number of participants said no single company or country was being singled out.
“It is an attempt to widen the discussion to a platform that should involve the entire Western civilization,” said one diplomatic source, adding that a non-binding summary by the chair to be issued on Friday was expected to provide principles for further discussions.
Conclusions from the conference would be informal as some participating countries were not ready to sign any documents in Prague because they had not concluded debates about the issue at home, another diplomatic source said.
A draft document seen by Reuters showed participants were discussing setting up certain security conditions for vendors that Chinese providers could find difficult to meet.
“Risk assessments of supplier’s products should take into account all relevant factors, including applicable legal environment and other aspects of a supplier’s ecosystem,” the draft said.
Huawei said it hoped the gathering would lead to a push for a more scientific and “unemotive” way of approaching technology.
“We fully support international standards, international verification that is based on facts and evidence,” Huawei Senior Vice President and Global Cyber Security & Privacy Officer John Suffolk told reporters.
The security issue is crucial because of 5G’s leading role in internet-connected products ranging from self-driving cars and smart cities to augmented reality and artificial intelligence. If underlying technology for 5G connectivity is vulnerable, it could allow hackers to exploit such products to spy or disrupt them.
Europe — where Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Lithuania and Portugal are all preparing to auction 5G licenses this year — has emerged as a key battle over Huawei’s next-generation technology.
Timo Koster, the Dutch government’s top diplomatic official for cyber security, said any global measures should be in line with European Commission requirements issued in March to share data on 5G cyber security risks.
“We need to find a balance between national security on the one hand and economic interests that we have on the other hand,” Koster said.",[]
839,"People from populations targeted by these immigration policies might also experience more discrimination, which worsens mental health.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-mental-immigration-policy/immigration-raids-tied-to-worse-mental-health-among-hispanic-americans-idUSKBN1XV2L2,reuters,immigration,center,42,1,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"(Reuters Health) - Hispanic Americans may experience worsening mental health when immigration arrests spike, a U.S. study suggests.
Researchers examined data on people who identified as Hispanic or Latino in nationally-representative behavioral health surveys administered from 2014 to 2018. Overall, more than one third of these participants reported at least one day of poor mental health in the previous month, and about 11% reported frequent mental distress.
During the study period, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) made 440,601 arrests, the study team notes in the American Journal of Public Health. Arrests increased sharply after a series of anti-immigration executive orders in 2017 that authorized a border wall with Mexico, banned U.S. entry for people from several predominantly Muslim countries, and modified ICE policies around arrests and deportation.
Changes in arrest rates varied by state. But each 1-percentage point increase in a state’s immigration arrest rate following these immigration policy changes was associated with significantly worse mental health outcomes for Hispanic people in the study.
“Given that immigration policy continues to be a deeply contested topic, ensuring that the health and social consequences of aggressive enforcement are identified and acknowledged within national debates is a key priority,” study authors Emilie Bruzelius of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University in New York City and Aaron Baum of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City write.
ICE has arrested more than 2 million immigrants living without authorization in the U.S. since 2008, the researchers note. Some previous research suggests that immigration-related anxiety could have a detrimental impact on mental health, particularly among racial/ethnic groups that have been disproportionately targeted for arrest and deportation.
Under current immigration policies, it’s possible that immigration arrests could lead to poor mental health by increasing deportation fears among undocumented individuals and their families and neighbors, the study authors write. People from populations targeted by these immigration policies might also experience more discrimination, which worsens mental health.
Across the entire study period, participants reported an average of 3.62 days of poor mental health during the previous month.
When researchers looked only at the 2017 shift in immigration policies, they didn’t find these policies to be associated with changes in mental health.
But when they looked at both the 2017 policy shifts and changes in arrest rates, they found states that had bigger spikes in arrest rates also had larger increases in the number of poor mental health days. These states also had bigger increases in the proportion of people reporting any days of poor mental health or frequent mental distress.
Compared to the period before the immigration policy shifts, a 1-percentage point increase in arrest rates after a policy shift was associated with a 14% higher risk of frequent mental distress and an 11% higher risk of any indications of poor mental health.
The study can’t prove that policy changes or arrest rates might directly impact mental health. Another limitation is that researchers lacked data on whether individual participants had experienced discrimination or were aware of immigration arrests or impacted personally by the policy changes.
The researchers also couldn’t account for any connection between changes in state-level immigration arrests and the proportion of undocumented residents.
“Additional research and, more important, public health action are urgently needed to mitigate the damaging effects of intensified anti-immigration enforcement measures and restrictive immigration policies on health,” the researchers conclude.

In its report, Variety wrote that Joaquin Phoenix was “true to his mysterious ways, [and] carried around a big plastic bottle of water.”
The Joker star made headlines earlier in the night in a wild political rant.
“Whether we’re talking about gender inequality or racism or queer rights or indigenous rights or animal rights, we’re talking about the fight against the belief, one nation, one race, one gender or one species has the right to dominate, control and use and exploit another with impunity,” Joaquin Phoenix said. “I think that we’ve become very disconnected from the natural world and many of us, what we’re guilty of is an egocentric world view, the belief that we’re the center of the universe.”

“I think we’ve become very disconnected from the natural world. … We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow, and then we take her baby. … Then we take her milk and put it in our coffee and our cereal,” Phoenix said. “I think we fear the idea of personal change, because we think we have to sacrifice something, to give something up. But human beings at our best are so inventive and creative and ingenious, I think that when we use love and compassion as our guiding principles, we can create, develop and implement systems of change that are beneficial to all sentient beings and to the environment.”
In January, Phoenix was arrested at a “climate change” protest led by actress Jane Fonda in Washington, D.C. He invited Americans to stop consuming animal products to combat “climate change.”
Phoenix claimed, “The meat and dairy industry its the third leading cause of climate change and I think sometimes we wonder what can we do in this fight against climate change, and there’s something you can do today, right now, and tomorrow by making a choice about what you consume.”
Despite framing consumption of fossil fuels as a driver of “climate change,” Phoenix admitted to having flown to join the protest in the nation’s capital. The event’s organizers endorsed the Green New Deal, calling for an end to use of fossil fuels.
Other left-wing narratives pushed by Phoenix include critiques of the entertainment industry’s “systemic racism” and “gender inequality.”
Hollywood celebrities have procured speechwriting services from agencies run by political operatives who previously worked for Democrat figureheads such as Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, according to a February-published report.

Attorney General Letitia James said the accord permanently bans Debt Resolve Inc, Progress Advocates LLC, Student Loan Care LLC and two of the companies’ executives, Bruce Bellmare and Stanley Freimuth, from the debt relief industry.
James said the companies also agreed to excuse outstanding consumer loans and accept a $5.5 million court judgment, but will pay just $250,000 to satisfy it because they are in bankruptcy and have a limited ability to pay.
The defendants did not admit or deny wrongdoing. Their lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The settlement requires court approval.
In the lawsuit, James accused 13 defendants of fraud and violating consumer protection laws, through such practices as promising loan forgiveness they could not deliver, and charging illegal upfront fees and excessive interest rates.
The lawsuit began in September 2018 under James’ predecessor Barbara Underwood. Twelve defendants have settled, resulting in $525,000 in restitution to consumers and more than $4 million in loan forbearance. The 13th defendant defaulted.

865,This would be the same Taliban that gleefully murders young women for the crime of going to school and regards democracy as a crime against Islam punishable by death.,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/EReXUAKj_UQ/,breitbart,international-politics-and-world-news,right,44,1,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The New York Times on Thursday published an op-ed written by Sirajuddin Haqqani, deputy leader of the Taliban and a globally designated terrorist with a $5 million FBI reward on his head.
Haqqani used the opportunity extended by the Times to recite Taliban propaganda and lay out the terrorist organization’s terms for peace in Afghanistan.
The FBI wants Haqqani for “questioning in connection with the January 2008 attack on a hotel in Kabul, Afghanistan, that killed six people, including an American citizen.” He is also wanted for participating in attacks on U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan and planning the attempted assassination of former Afghan President Hamid Karzai in 2008.
Haqqani is not only deputy commander of the Taliban but also the operational commander of the Haqqani Network, the infamous criminal gang and internationally designated terrorist organization allied with the Taliban that is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks and kidnappings, including U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl. Sirajuddin Haqqani’s father Jalaluddin, founder of the network, died after a long illness several years ago.
The New York Times did not see fit to provide any of this background information to readers, identifying Sirajuddin Haqqani as merely “deputy leader of the Taliban.”
In his op-ed, Haqqani portrayed the Taliban as reasonable negotiators appalled by the loss of life in Afghanistan, excusing his group’s atrocities and remorseless attacks on civilians as justified acts of self-defense. He blamed the United States for undermining previous efforts at working out a peace deal.
“We did not choose our war with the foreign coalition led by the United States. We were forced to defend ourselves. The withdrawal of foreign forces has been our first and foremost demand. That we today stand at the threshold of a peace agreement with the United States is no small milestone,” Haqqani wrote.
The terrorist leader claimed that his side stuck with the current round of negotiations despite “the intensified bombing campaign against our villages by the United States and the flip-flopping and ever-moving goal posts of the American side.”
Haqqani claimed the Taliban are just looking for a round of free and fair elections, laughably pretending the murderous Islamist extremists would cheerfully accept losing and head back to their caves in peace if the Afghan people reject them:
We are aware of the concerns and questions in and outside Afghanistan about the kind of government we would have after the foreign troops withdraw. My response to such concerns is that it will depend on a consensus among Afghans. We should not let our worries get in the way of a process of genuine discussion and deliberation free for the first time from foreign domination and interference. It is important that no one front-loads this process with predetermined outcomes and preconditions. We are committed to working with other parties in a consultative manner of genuine respect to agree on a new, inclusive political system in which the voice of every Afghan is reflected and where no Afghan feels excluded. I am confident that, liberated from foreign domination and interference, we together will find a way to build an Islamic system in which all Afghans have equal rights, where the rights of women that are granted by Islam — from the right to education to the right to work — are protected, and where merit is the basis for equal opportunity.
This would be the same Taliban that gleefully murders young women for the crime of going to school and regards democracy as a crime against Islam punishable by death.
Haqqani claimed concerns about the Taliban allowing Afghanistan to be used as a staging ground for international terrorist organizations are “politically motivated exaggerations by the warmongering players on all sides of the war” and pledged to “take all measures in partnership with other Afghans to make sure the new Afghanistan is a bastion of stability and that nobody feels threatened on our soil.”
“We are ready to work on the basis of mutual respect with our international partners on long-term peace-building and reconstruction. After the United States withdraws its troops, it can play a constructive role in the postwar development and reconstruction of Afghanistan,” he wrote.
The bottom line, laid out at the end of Haqqani’s op-ed, is that the United States is clearly interested in ending its nearly two-decade involvement in Afghanistan’s endless bloodshed, and the Taliban wants the U.S. to depart badly enough to make a few immediate practical concessions plus a few long-term rhetorical concessions that everyone will pretend to believe until American troops are gone:
We are about to sign an agreement with the United States and we are fully committed to carrying out its every single provision, in letter and spirit. Achieving the potential of the agreement, ensuring its success and earning lasting peace will depend on an equally scrupulous observance by the United States of each of its commitments. Only then can we have complete trust and lay the foundation for cooperation — or even a partnership — in the future. My fellow Afghans will soon celebrate this historic agreement. Once it is entirely fulfilled, Afghans will see the departure of all foreign troops. As we arrive at this milestone, I believe it is not a distant dream that we will soon see the day when we will come together with all our Afghan brothers and sisters, start moving toward lasting peace and lay the foundation of a new Afghanistan. We would then celebrate a new beginning that invites all our compatriots to return from their exile to our country — to our shared home where everybody would have the right to live with dignity, in peace.
The tragedy of America’s 18 years in Afghanistan has been a stubborn refusal to admit the Afghan government is incapable of standing on its own, no matter how much money is poured into it, how much training its troops are given, or how many of its battles American soldiers fight. There is not much left to do except hope the Afghans rise to the occasion and hold the Taliban to some of the promises it is making.
The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) argued in August that Sirajuddin Haqqani’s position in both terrorist groups made him the man the Trump administration needed to talk to, in order to hammer out a workable exit plan from Afghanistan.
Among other factors, CFR noted the Haqqani Network is a more potent international terror threat than the Taliban and more interested in “international jihad,” while the Taliban is more focused on regaining control of Afghanistan. Haqqani’s patronage is also vital to the survival of jihadi groups in Pakistan and expanding jihad franchises beyond the Middle East.
CFR quoted the assessment of Gen. John R. Allen, former commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan, saying, “Although many Jihadi groups are sending their rank and file to places like Syria, few of these groups have the close relations with al Qaeda, media savvy, military capability, and technical expertise for suicide attacks like the Haqqani network.” For example, not many other jihad groups are media-savvy enough to get op-eds published in the New York Times without any mention of the outstanding FBI warrants for their arrest.","['gleefully', 'murders', 'democracy', 'crime']"

Until the last few years, all Washington could talk about was how to cut Social Security benefits, and by how much. But a grass-roots progressive coalition began campaigning for expansion in 2013, and the idea has since moved straight to the heart of the Democratic Party.
That was evident this week when U.S. Representative John Larson introduced his Social Security 2100 Act in the House of Representatives. The Connecticut Democrat’s proposal calls for a small across-the-board bump in benefits, a more generous annual cost-of-living adjustment and a higher minimum benefit for low-income workers. Larson’s plan would pay for the expansion in two ways. First, it would add new payroll taxes to wages over $400,000 (currently, tax collection stops at $132,900 of annual income). The bill also would gradually phase in a higher payroll tax rate, with workers and employers each paying 7.4 percent by 2042, compared with the current rate of 6.2 percent.
This is not the first time Larson has proposed this legislation, but this year it stands a very good chance of passage in the House. The proposal had 54 co-sponsors when Larson first introduced it in 2015; now, it has more than 200 House co-sponsors - more than 85 percent of the Democratic majority.
Larson himself is the new chairman of the Social Security subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. The new chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, Massachusetts Democrat Richard Neal, is a co-sponsor of the bill.
Moreover, progressive support for Social Security expansion was an important campaign plank for many successful Democratic candidates in November’s midterm elections. And nearly every declared and potential Democratic presidential candidate has endorsed expansion of some type for Social Security.
The bill is not likely to become law while Republicans control the Senate and White House. But Larson plans to hold hearings on the bill this year in Washington and around the country - the first congressional hearings focused on expansion in 50 years.
That will provide an important forum to help educate the public and could puncture many of the toxic myths that have taken hold about Social Security in recent decades. Among the most pernicious of those myths is that Social Security is headed for bankruptcy, and that benefits will not be there for young people when their retirement rolls around.
“We need to educate and unmask so many of these myths,” Larson told me in an interview. “We need to talk about why Social Security is an earned benefit and not an entitlement. Certainly it is something you are entitled to, but the word makes Social Security sound like a poverty program or a handout. Nothing roils people who have been paying into the program their entire lives more.”
FIXING THE SHORTFALL
The myths are built on one very important kernel of truth. Social Security does face a shortfall in revenue needed to pay scheduled benefits. If Congress fails to act, Social Security benefits will be cut nearly 25 percent in 2034 - just 15 years from now. This would be a financial disaster for current and future retirees, and it would undermine trust in the program.
Larson’s bill puts Social Security back into balance over the next 75 years - the period of time the program is required by federal law to project its finances. On the benefit side, it provides an increase for all enrollees equivalent to 2 percent of the average benefit, about $30 per month. It would shift to a more generous annual cost-of-living adjustment formula that is more sensitive to medical inflation and other costs disproportionately affecting seniors. The bill would also beef up the special minimum benefit paid to low-income retirees.
For higher-income seniors, the bill also includes, effectively, a benefit boost in the form of a tax cut.
Beneficiaries with higher income - usually from work, a pension or drawdowns from tax-deferred saving - often wind up paying income taxes on their Social Security benefits.
The proportion of benefit that is taxable is determined using a formula called “provisional income” - your adjusted gross income (excluding Social Security benefits), plus non-taxable interest and half of your Social Security benefits. If your provisional income is $25,000 to $34,000 (single return) or $32,000 to $44,000 (joint return), up to 50 percent of your Social Security benefit must be counted as adjusted gross income. If your provisional income is more than $34,000 on a single return or $44,000 on a joint return, 85 percent must be added to AGI.
The Larson bill would replace those thresholds with $50,000 (single filer) and $100,000 (joint filers), and if provisional income is above those levels, up to 85 percent is counted in adjusted gross income.
Despite the bill’s strong odds in the House, the Republican-controlled Senate is not likely to take it up this year - although Larson says he is reaching out. He also has put feelers out to the White House, noting that President Donald Trump opposed cuts to Social Security during the 2016 campaign.

880,"In Spain, hundreds of thousands of women, wearing purple and raising their fists, took to the streets of cities around the country calling for greater gender equality.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-womens-day/gender-equality-rights-on-agenda-on-international-womens-day-idUSKCN1QP18R?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews,reuters,gender,center,45,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"LONDON (Reuters) - Campaigners for gender equality took to European city streets on Friday to mark International Women’s Day with celebrations and protests, while in Turkey police fired tear gas to break up a crowd of several thousand women in Istanbul in the evening.
In Spain, hundreds of thousands of women, wearing purple and raising their fists, took to the streets of cities around the country calling for greater gender equality.
The issue has become deeply divisive in Spain ahead of a national election on April 28. A new far-right party, Vox, has called for a 2004 law on domestic violence against women to be scrapped, and stands to win dozens of seats, opinion polls show.
In Berlin, city authorities declared Women’s Day a formal holiday and thousands joined a colorful demonstration under sunny skies at the German capital’s Alexanderplatz.
In Paris, demonstrators from Amnesty International waved placards outside the Saudi Arabian embassy that read “Honk for women’s rights”, and called for the release of jailed women activists, including some campaigners for the right to drive in the deeply conservative kingdom.
In Athens and Kiev, women protesters demanded equality and an end to violence against women.
In Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city, hundreds called for the release of Syrian women in jail. But in the evening, Turkish police fired tear gas to break up a crowd gathered for a march, Reuters witnesses said.
Hundreds of riot police blocked the marchers’ path to prevent them advancing along the district’s main pedestrian avenue. Police then fired pepper spray and pellets containing tear gas to disperse the crowd, and scuffles broke out as they pursued the women into side streets off the avenue.
It was not clear if anyone was hurt or if people were detained.
Turkish police regularly block the staging of protests in central Istanbul and elsewhere. Ankara tightened restrictions after the imposition of emergency rule following an attempted coup in 2016. The state of emergency was lifted last July.
EQUALITY AND RESPECT
In Russia, where Women’s Day has been an important festival since Communist times, flowers and congratulatory messages decorated public spaces.
In Spain, one of the country’s largest unions, UGT, said an estimated 6 million people went on strike across the country for at least two hours to demand equal pay and rights for women.
Spain’s government said it would not provide estimates on the rate of participation.
“Many people are trying to demonize feminism while it has always been a fight for equality,” said Ana Sanz, 36, dressed in a red overcoat and white bonnet echoing the uniforms worn in the dystopian novel and TV series “The Handmaid’s Tale”.
Tens of thousands of women, mostly students, crammed streets and squares in the Spanish capital Madrid, chanting and carrying placards saying: “Liberty, Equality, Friendship” and “The way I dress does not change the respect I deserve!”

In Berlin’s Alexanderplatz, protester Anna Lob told Reuters she had been sexually assaulted during an internship.
“A male colleague grabbed my ass while I was standing in a circle with some men,” she said. “Physical assaults in any form or (sexist) comments, jokes or something you have to listen to over and over again - that is a form of discrimination.”
Also in Alexanderplatz, Paula Schramm said she had seen some moves toward greater equality but many women remained disadvantaged in their daily lives. “And that is why I am here. I want to change this so that it becomes equal at some point.”
In Paris, Cameroonian rights activist Aissa Doumara was honored for her campaign against forced marriages by President Emmanuel Macron. At a ceremony at the Elysee Palace, he handed Doumara the first women’s rights prize dedicated to the late French minister and abortion campaigner Simone Veil.
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa joined a women’s rights protest in downtown Lisbon. “When there is a difference of 18 percent on average between the salary of men and women, disparity in political positions, and when there is barbarity such as gender violence, it’s a sign that there is still much to do in the fight for women’s rights,” he told the crowd.
Twelve women have died so far this year in domestic violence in Portugal.
“EMBRYONIC KICKING OF FEMINISM”
In London, Meghan, Britain’s Duchess of Sussex, said she hoped the baby she is expecting this spring with Britain’s Prince Harry would follow in her feminist footsteps.
The ex-“Suits” actress made the comment during a Women’s Day panel discussion at King’s College London.

886,"The tragedy of America’s 18 years in Afghanistan has been a stubborn refusal to admit the Afghan government is incapable of standing on its own, no matter how much money is poured into it, how much training its troops are given, or how many of its battles American soldiers fight.",http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/EReXUAKj_UQ/,breitbart,international-politics-and-world-news,right,45,1,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The New York Times on Thursday published an op-ed written by Sirajuddin Haqqani, deputy leader of the Taliban and a globally designated terrorist with a $5 million FBI reward on his head.
Haqqani used the opportunity extended by the Times to recite Taliban propaganda and lay out the terrorist organization’s terms for peace in Afghanistan.
The FBI wants Haqqani for “questioning in connection with the January 2008 attack on a hotel in Kabul, Afghanistan, that killed six people, including an American citizen.” He is also wanted for participating in attacks on U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan and planning the attempted assassination of former Afghan President Hamid Karzai in 2008.
Haqqani is not only deputy commander of the Taliban but also the operational commander of the Haqqani Network, the infamous criminal gang and internationally designated terrorist organization allied with the Taliban that is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks and kidnappings, including U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl. Sirajuddin Haqqani’s father Jalaluddin, founder of the network, died after a long illness several years ago.
The New York Times did not see fit to provide any of this background information to readers, identifying Sirajuddin Haqqani as merely “deputy leader of the Taliban.”
In his op-ed, Haqqani portrayed the Taliban as reasonable negotiators appalled by the loss of life in Afghanistan, excusing his group’s atrocities and remorseless attacks on civilians as justified acts of self-defense. He blamed the United States for undermining previous efforts at working out a peace deal.
“We did not choose our war with the foreign coalition led by the United States. We were forced to defend ourselves. The withdrawal of foreign forces has been our first and foremost demand. That we today stand at the threshold of a peace agreement with the United States is no small milestone,” Haqqani wrote.
The terrorist leader claimed that his side stuck with the current round of negotiations despite “the intensified bombing campaign against our villages by the United States and the flip-flopping and ever-moving goal posts of the American side.”
Haqqani claimed the Taliban are just looking for a round of free and fair elections, laughably pretending the murderous Islamist extremists would cheerfully accept losing and head back to their caves in peace if the Afghan people reject them:
We are aware of the concerns and questions in and outside Afghanistan about the kind of government we would have after the foreign troops withdraw. My response to such concerns is that it will depend on a consensus among Afghans. We should not let our worries get in the way of a process of genuine discussion and deliberation free for the first time from foreign domination and interference. It is important that no one front-loads this process with predetermined outcomes and preconditions. We are committed to working with other parties in a consultative manner of genuine respect to agree on a new, inclusive political system in which the voice of every Afghan is reflected and where no Afghan feels excluded. I am confident that, liberated from foreign domination and interference, we together will find a way to build an Islamic system in which all Afghans have equal rights, where the rights of women that are granted by Islam — from the right to education to the right to work — are protected, and where merit is the basis for equal opportunity.
This would be the same Taliban that gleefully murders young women for the crime of going to school and regards democracy as a crime against Islam punishable by death.
Haqqani claimed concerns about the Taliban allowing Afghanistan to be used as a staging ground for international terrorist organizations are “politically motivated exaggerations by the warmongering players on all sides of the war” and pledged to “take all measures in partnership with other Afghans to make sure the new Afghanistan is a bastion of stability and that nobody feels threatened on our soil.”
“We are ready to work on the basis of mutual respect with our international partners on long-term peace-building and reconstruction. After the United States withdraws its troops, it can play a constructive role in the postwar development and reconstruction of Afghanistan,” he wrote.
The bottom line, laid out at the end of Haqqani’s op-ed, is that the United States is clearly interested in ending its nearly two-decade involvement in Afghanistan’s endless bloodshed, and the Taliban wants the U.S. to depart badly enough to make a few immediate practical concessions plus a few long-term rhetorical concessions that everyone will pretend to believe until American troops are gone:
We are about to sign an agreement with the United States and we are fully committed to carrying out its every single provision, in letter and spirit. Achieving the potential of the agreement, ensuring its success and earning lasting peace will depend on an equally scrupulous observance by the United States of each of its commitments. Only then can we have complete trust and lay the foundation for cooperation — or even a partnership — in the future. My fellow Afghans will soon celebrate this historic agreement. Once it is entirely fulfilled, Afghans will see the departure of all foreign troops. As we arrive at this milestone, I believe it is not a distant dream that we will soon see the day when we will come together with all our Afghan brothers and sisters, start moving toward lasting peace and lay the foundation of a new Afghanistan. We would then celebrate a new beginning that invites all our compatriots to return from their exile to our country — to our shared home where everybody would have the right to live with dignity, in peace.
The tragedy of America’s 18 years in Afghanistan has been a stubborn refusal to admit the Afghan government is incapable of standing on its own, no matter how much money is poured into it, how much training its troops are given, or how many of its battles American soldiers fight. There is not much left to do except hope the Afghans rise to the occasion and hold the Taliban to some of the promises it is making.
The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) argued in August that Sirajuddin Haqqani’s position in both terrorist groups made him the man the Trump administration needed to talk to, in order to hammer out a workable exit plan from Afghanistan.
Among other factors, CFR noted the Haqqani Network is a more potent international terror threat than the Taliban and more interested in “international jihad,” while the Taliban is more focused on regaining control of Afghanistan. Haqqani’s patronage is also vital to the survival of jihadi groups in Pakistan and expanding jihad franchises beyond the Middle East.
CFR quoted the assessment of Gen. John R. Allen, former commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan, saying, “Although many Jihadi groups are sending their rank and file to places like Syria, few of these groups have the close relations with al Qaeda, media savvy, military capability, and technical expertise for suicide attacks like the Haqqani network.” For example, not many other jihad groups are media-savvy enough to get op-eds published in the New York Times without any mention of the outstanding FBI warrants for their arrest.","['stubborn', 'incapable', 'tragedy']"

Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, is mounting a late challenge for the Democratic nomination, blanketing airwaves with television ads.
The candidate has quickly built a 1,000-person campaign staff while releasing progressive proposals, including a pledge on Wednesday to ban flavored e-cigarettes, but he trails Democratic frontrunners Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in polls. The Democratic nominee will face Republican President Donald Trump in the November election.
Dogging Bloomberg’s campaign are allegations that he made inappropriate comments toward women and that his company, Bloomberg LP, fostered a hostile environment for female employees.
“Did I ever tell a bawdy joke? Yeah, sure I did. And do I regret it? Yes. It’s embarrassing,” Bloomberg, 77, told ABC’s “The View.” “But, you know, that’s the way I grew up.”
Bloomberg did not reference specific jokes. ABC News reported in December that it obtained a copy of a 32-page booklet distributed at a party in 1990 that included sexist remarks by Bloomberg, reportedly compiled by his colleagues. The same report chronicled numerous discrimination lawsuits filed against Bloomberg LP over the last three decades.
In one notable instance, a saleswoman filed a lawsuit in 1997 alleging that when she told Bloomberg she was pregnant, his response was, “Kill it,” according to news reports at the time. Bloomberg at the time denied making the remark, and the lawsuit was settled.
Bloomberg said the company, a major provider of news and financial information to Wall Street, has “very few” cases of sexual harassment given its large size, and said he thinks “most people would say we’re a great place to work.”
He said the company would not release women from non-disclosure agreements that were part of legal settlements, some of which stemmed from allegations of sexual harassment by Bloomberg LP employees. One of Bloomberg’s rivals, Warren, a Democratic U.S. senator, has called on Bloomberg to release the women from the agreements.
In an ongoing case in New York, the plaintiff asked a judge in December to invalidate her agreement with Bloomberg LP as well as any signed by other people.
On Wednesday night, Bloomberg launched an outreach effort, “Women for Mike,” at a Manhattan hotel ballroom where he celebrated his victory in a mayoral race a decade ago.
A crowd that his campaign said topped 1,000 people swept up free wine, cheese and coin-sized hamburgers while Bloomberg’s longtime girlfriend Diana Taylor, “The Sopranos” actress Lorraine Bracco and a female campaign staffer endorsed Bloomberg.
“All of my success in life - everything I’ve done - is thanks to the strong women around me,” Bloomberg said, pivoting to his support for reproductive rights. “In many parts of this country, and certainly in Washington, women’s rights are under attack and so are women themselves.”
Women make up a larger share of the U.S. voting population than men and they report being less sure about which candidate they support in the Democratic presidential primary. About six in 10 women Democrats have a favorable impression of Bloomberg, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll last month, a lower share than several of Bloomberg’s opponents.",['sexist']

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. electric carmaker Tesla’s (TSLA.O) factory in China’s financial hub of Shanghai will resume production on Feb. 10 with assistance to help it cope with a spreading epidemic of coronavirus, a Shanghai government official said on Saturday.
Many factories across China shut in late January for the Lunar New Year holiday that was originally due to end on Jan. 30 but which was extended in a bid to contain the spread of the new flu-like virus that has killed more than 700 people.
Tesla warned on Jan. 30 that it would see a 1-1.5 week delay in the ramp-up of Shanghai-built Model 3 cars as a result of the epidemic, which has severely disrupted communications and supply chains across China.
Tesla Vice President Tao Lin said this week that production would restart on Feb. 10 and that car deliveries from the plant would be temporarily delayed.
“In view of the practical difficulties key manufacturing firms including Tesla have faced in resuming production, we will coordinate to make all efforts to help companies resume production as soon as possible,” Shanghai municipal government spokesman Xu Wei said.
The $2 billion Shanghai factory is Tesla’s first outside the United States and was built with support from local authorities. It started production in October and began deliveries last month.
The Shanghai government also said on Saturday it would ask banks to extend loans with preferential rates to small companies and exempt firms in hard-hit sectors like hospitality from value-added tax, among other measures to prop up businesses during the epidemic.
Such assistance would also apply to foreign companies.","['severely', 'disrupted', 'warned']"

FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump looks on during the daily Coronavirus-related briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S. March 9, 2020. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo
Trump advisers on the White House economic team and Republican lawmakers are pushing for more targeted stimulus. But Trump has held firm on the idea, White House and Republican sources say.
Trump told Republican senators in a meeting on Tuesday he would like to waive the payroll tax entirely through the end of the year, or even permanently suspend it, one attendee told Reuters, even though Democrats have openly rejected the idea.
House of Representatives Speaker “Nancy Pelosi all of a sudden doesn’t like the payroll tax cut,” Trump tweeted Thursday morning, “but when Obama proposed it she thought it was a brilliant thing.”
If approved by Congress, Trump's proposal would result in a massive, roughly $1 trillion dollar cash injection into the pockets of workers and businesses over the rest of the year, based on a Congressional Budget Office estimate www.cbo.gov/topics/taxes of current projected federal tax revenue.
It would also mean “you’ve blown a trillion-dollar hole” in the trust funds that pay Social Security benefits for retirees and help fund the Medicare healthcare program for Americans over age 65, said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. “What do you do about that?”
U.S. workers and their employers each contribute 7.65% of the employees’ gross pay for Social Security and Medicare through the payroll tax. As Trump’s tweet indicates, tweaking this tax to stimulate the economy is not a brand-new idea.
An Obama administration 2011 payroll tax cut to counteract the Great Recession, for example, returned $109 billion to households by cutting 2 percentage points from the amount that employees pay the federal government. In that case, the Treasury put a similar amount into the Social Security fund to make up the loss.
Trump’s proposal, to eliminate both the workers’ and employers’ payments, is of a different scale. Unless it is also somehow replaced, it could exacerbate funding shortfalls that the two popular programs already face in coming years, as the U.S. population ages and demand for healthcare increases.
Nearly 90% of Social Security's budget here came from payroll taxes in 2018, according to U.S. government figures. Medicare, which provides 18% of the U.S. population with health insurance, was 36% funded from payroll taxes in 2018, reports here the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a think tank.
If Trump were successful in making the payroll tax cuts permanent, he would hope to fund Social Security and Medicare from general revenue, a Republican source says.
That move could balloon the U.S. budget deficit, which will top $1 trillion this year, despite the strong economy, the CBO estimates.
Congressional leaders from both parties were skeptical the idea would fly.
The idea of a payroll tax cut is a “nonstarter” and will not be included in Democrats’ stimulus legislation, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said on Wednesday.
Democrats are not interested in the idea, U.S. Senator John Thune, a member of the Republican leadership, told Fox News on Wednesday. But, he said, the payroll tax remains a “big component” of the president’s stimulus plan.
DO PAYROLL TAX CUTS WORK?
Moody’s Analytics estimated that a full pandemic, with 3 million to 4 million infections globally, might lead the U.S. economy to end 2020 about 1.5% smaller than it was at the end of 2019, ending a decade-long expansion.
It is not clear a payroll tax cut would offset even a milder shock.
During the Great Recession, the U.S. government’s all-hands-on-deck fiscal response included industry bailouts, and a variety of tax cuts and stimulus payments. The moral of the story then was that sending people larger checks all at once works better than parceling money out a paycheck at a time.
Of the $100 billion in onetime stimulus checks mailed to 130 million people in 2008, up to 90% got spent, according to 2011 research on the program’s impact.
Smaller sums tucked into weekly paychecks in the form of a payroll tax cut were spent at about perhaps half that rate, according to research by the New York Fed, with the rest saved or applied to debt.
“Right now is when people are freaking out,” said Claudia Sahm, director of macroeconomic policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. “They don’t need an extra 50 bucks in October. They need an extra 500 bucks now,” to allay fears about lost jobs or wages, pay for medical tests, or ease the need to cut back spending right away.
Sending $500 per person right away, at a cost of around $165 billion to the government, could act as a sort of circuit breaker to avoid a recession and boost confidence among households, she said.

Senator Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said Tuesday the tax cut would not necessarily help the most vulnerable workers.
To benefit from a payroll tax cut, first of all, you need to be employed, he said.
In addition “it doesn’t do a lot for people who rely on tips. It doesn’t do much for people who have lost shifts. It does very little for folks who don’t have sick leave,” Wyden told reporters. “So there are important issues to work through.”",['favorite']

By Matt Spetalnick and Humeyra Pamuk
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Reuters) - There is a growing push within the Trump administration to craft a list of retaliatory measures against China over its role in the coronavirus outbreak, three sources, including a U.S. official, familiar with the matter said, but cautioned the efforts were in early stages.
President Donald Trump has shown increasing frustration with China in recent weeks over the pandemic, which has cost tens of thousands of lives in the United States alone, sparked an economic contraction and threatened Trump’s chances of re-election in November.
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that a range of options were under discussion but that it had not yet reached the level of Trump’s top national security team or been taken to the president.
A range of options are being discussed, informally for now by officials across an array of government agencies, including the State Department, White House National Security Council, Treasury Department and Pentagon, two of the sources said.
“There is a discussion as to how hard to hit China and how to calibrate it properly,” one of the sources said as Washington walks a tight rope in its ties with Beijing while it imports personal protection equipment (PPE) from there and is also wary of hurting a sensitive trade deal.
The Washington Post, citing two people with knowledge of internal discussions, reported on Thursday that some administration officials had discussed the idea of canceling some debt held by China as a way to strike at Beijing for perceived shortfalls in its candidness on the COVID-19 pandemic.
Trump’s top economic adviser denied the report. “The full faith and credit of U.S. debt obligations is sacrosanct. Period. Full stop,” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Reuters. “Similarly is the reserve currency status of the U.S. dollar,” Kudlow said. “The story’s completely wrong.”
Trump told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday that he was looking at different options in terms of consequences for Beijing over the virus. “I can do a lot,” he said.
Among the ideas under consideration are sanctions, a new round of tariffs or other trade restrictions, and a possible effort to lift China’s sovereign immunity, two sources said.
The strongest pressure for action is coming from the National Security Council, including deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger, while Treasury officials are advising caution, the sources said.
Conversations are at a very preliminary stage and significant action is not considered imminent, the sources said. When asked, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has repeatedly said Washington’s priority at the moment was to fight the virus but warned the time to hold Chinese accountable would come.
“Timing matters,” one of the sources said, and added that there was still much debate to be had on any tangible measures. (Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk, Matt Spetalnick, Jeff Mason and Tim Ahmann Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jonathan Oatis)",[]
977,"Gun control advocates said gun rights groups are sowing fear during the pandemic in order to boost firearms sales, adding that increased gun ownership during the crisis could lead to more domestic violence.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-guns/trump-coronavirus-guidance-on-keeping-gun-stores-open-draws-criticism-idUSKBN21H37L?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews,reuters,gun-control,center,49,1,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Gun control activists on Monday criticized guidance issued by President Donald Trump’s administration recommending that states find that gun stores are critical businesses that can stay open during the coronavirus crisis.

The new guidance, issued on Saturday by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, offers the administration’s views on which workers are essential during the pandemic at a time when state governors have ordered numerous “non-essential” businesses to close to try to limit the spread of the virus. The agency is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Gun control advocates said gun rights groups are sowing fear during the pandemic in order to boost firearms sales, adding that increased gun ownership during the crisis could lead to more domestic violence.
“Adding more guns to more homes during a time of more anxiety could lead to more deaths. And that’s the last thing we need when our hospitals are already bursting at the seams,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a leading gun control group.
Kris Brown, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said gun industry groups have “exploited the current crisis to further the interests of gun manufacturers.”
The agency’s guidance stated that “workers supporting the operation of firearm or ammunition product manufacturers, retailers, importers, distributors and shooting ranges” are among those the administration considers vital during the crisis. Other essential businesses listed included healthcare facilities, grocery stores, transportation companies and the energy sector.
The guidance carries no formal legal weight. Governors, who decide the content of emergency orders like those already in place in numerous states, do not have to follow it though they could cite it as justification for their decisions.
The list is intended to help states “protect their communities, while ensuring continuity of functions critical to public health and safety,” Christopher Krebs, the agency’s director, wrote in a memorandum issued with the new guidance.
The administration’s intervention has been welcomed by gun rights groups, which have been lobbying to keep gun stores open and in some case filing lawsuits in several states including California and New Jersey.
“In these uncertain times, the ability to protect yourself - and to acquire firearms, magazines and ammunition - should not be ignored,” said Erich Pratt, senior vice president of Gun Owners of America.
The most influential U.S. gun rights group, the National Rifle Association, also backed the administration’s move. Trump, seeking re-election on Nov. 3, and other Republicans are closely aligned with the NRA.
The dispute over guns is one of several new fronts in the U.S. culture wars on issues including abortion and voting rights that have emerged as the pandemic causes widespread disruption of daily life.","['sowing', 'fear']"
984,"That has led to fears that gangs could exploit undocumented migrants already in the country for cheap labor, an established but illegal practice known as “caporalato” that one United Nations expert has called a form of modern slavery.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-italy-slavery-trfn/italys-lockdown-labor-crunch-sparks-fears-of-mafia-exploitation-idUSKBN2222MO,reuters,coronavirus,center,50,1,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"ROME (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Mafia exploitation of immigrants on farms in Italy is likely to rise as the coronavirus lockdown brings chronic labor shortages, the government and labor rights groups have warned.
Italy normally depends on 370,000 foreign workers to bring in its harvest, but travel restrictions to stop the spread of the virus have made that impossible, jeopardizing a quarter of its produce, according to farmers’ association Coldiretti.
That has led to fears that gangs could exploit undocumented migrants already in the country for cheap labor, an established but illegal practice known as “caporalato” that one United Nations expert has called a form of modern slavery.
“In this moment ... it can be easy for the mafia to use some people in Italy, like migrants without documents, to make them work (in farms),” said Carmelo Troccoli, a director at Coldiretti, Italy’s largest farming association.
“We are strongly fighting against this type of crime in Italy because it touches all farmers - in the south, in the center and in the north,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Troccoli was referring to Italy’s agricultural mafia, organized crime groups that Coldiretti has said set crop prices, manage transport, control entire supermarket chains and have an annual turnover of 24.5 billion euros ($26.65 billion).
Italy is home to more than 600,000 undocumented, mostly African migrants, who are vulnerable to such exploitation, according to agriculture minister Teresa Bellanova, who has proposed regularizing some to allow them to work legally.
Because they do not have the legal right to live and work in Italy, many are reluctant to turn to authorities for help.
If the state failed to take responsibility for these people, organized crime would step in, Bellanova told Italy’s Senate last week.
Earlier this month, more than a dozen non-governmental and religious organizations including Action Aid and Caritas Italiana made a similar call.
Under the caporalato system, which has been going for decades in Italy, migrants work long hours for wages below the national minimum and are subjected to violence, said Italy’s farmers’ union in 2018.
Such conditions are akin “to those of modern slavery”, said Hilal Elver, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to food, after her visit to Italy in January 2020.
Roberto Caponi, director of labor and welfare policies in Italian agricultural association Confagricoltura said the shortage of labor should be filled through unemployed Italians and opening corridors with Eastern Europe.
Both Coldiretti and Confagricoltura have set up online platforms to match job-seekers to local farms.","['exploit', 'slavery', 'modern', 'fears']"

1043,The Trump administration is working on a plan to let the Social Security Administration (SSA) check up on claimants on Facebook and Twitter in order to root out fraud and abuse in the disability program.,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-column-miller-socialmedia/u-s-government-weighs-social-media-snooping-to-detect-social-security-fraud-idUSKCN1RA12R,reuters,middle-class,center,53,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Getting followed on social media could soon gain a new meaning for workers applying for Social Security disability benefits. The Trump administration is working on a plan to let the Social Security Administration (SSA) check up on claimants on Facebook and Twitter in order to root out fraud and abuse in the disability program.

It is the latest move in a push by critics of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) to crack down on alleged fraud and abuse. Conservatives have long argued that cheating is rampant in the program, and in recent years convinced Congress to fund expanded efforts by the SSA on anti-fraud efforts.
The idea of social media surveillance is getting a push from the conservative Heritage Foundation. Such monitoring already is done in some fraud and abuse investigations. For example, in 2014, the SSA’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) utilized social media reviews to help arrest more than 100 people who defrauded SSDI out of millions of dollars. Investigators found photos on the personal accounts of disability claimants riding on jet skis, performing physical stunts in karate studios and driving motorcycles.
The SSA now is looking at expanding social media monitoring capability to front-line agency staff who work with claimants in the initial stages, before any investigations have been initiated.
The idea already is drawing fire from disability advocates. They argue that social media profiles can offer misleading evidence, since dates when photos were shot are not always clear and because not all legitimate disabilities prevent participation in activities that might seem suspicious.
“The proposal to allow disability adjudicators to monitor or review social media of disability claimants is an unjustified invasion of privacy unlikely to uncover fraud,” said Lisa Ekman, director of government affairs at the National Organization of Social Security Claimants’ Representatives.
The prospect of such governmental surveillance is as disturbing as it is eyebrow-raising. Consider that workers and employers split a 1.8 percent payroll tax to fund SSDI. Now, in return, the SSA may be empowered to snoop around their Facebook profiles. And it is premised on a questionable assertion - namely, that SSDI really is plagued by rampant fraud and abuse.
For starters, let me stipulate that SSDI is not a perfect program. One of the biggest problems is the staggering backlog in appeals cases, with applicants often waiting more than 600 days for decisions on claims. That problem stems from a history of unwise slashing of the SSA budget by Congress in recent years that has left the program dramatically short-staffed.
Fraud and abuse do exist in the program, and it should be weeded out to protect taxpayers and legitimate claimants. But any program this large - public or private-sector - is sure to be a target for people bent on taking advantage, and critics often argue by highlighting sensational cases.
Mark Hinkle, acting press officer for the SSA, notes that the agency uses data analytics and predictive modeling to detect fraud, and has created new groups dedicated to detection and prevention. Asked to comment on plans for expanded use of social media to detect fraud, he confirmed that SSA investigative units already use social media, and that the agency has “studied strategies of other agencies and private entities to determine how social media might be used to evaluate disability applications.”
He added, “Social Security does not currently pursue social media in disability determinations, and we don’t have other information to provide at this time.”
DISABILITY FRAUD IS RARE
Program statistics do not support the allegation that SSDI is riddled with fraud and abuse.
In the government’s fiscal-year 2018, the SSA’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) reported about $98 million in recoveries, fines, settlements/judgments, and restitution as a result of Social Security fraud investigations. The OIG states that most the recovered funds were from recipients of SSDI and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), a means-tested welfare program for low-income seniors, blind and disabled people.
That sounds like big money. But in fiscal 2018, the SSA paid out $197 billion to beneficiaries of SSDI and SSI. And keep in mind that the recovered $98 million was for benefits paid out over several years, not just in 2018.
SSA data shows that the rate of overpayments for all its programs was well under 1 percent of benefit payouts in each of the last three fiscal years - and not all improper payments are fraud. More often, overpayments occur due to administrative delays at the SSA in making adjustments to benefit amounts due to errors and paperwork snafus.
A federal government list of programs at highest risk for making improper payments compiled by the Office of Management and Budget does not even mention Social Security.
Considering all that, I asked Rachel Greszler, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation who studies Social Security, to justify the foundation’s steady drumbeat of accusations that SSDI is plagued by fraud and abuse.
She readily acknowledged that fraud rates are low. “Outright fraud is actually a pretty small component of the program’s problems,” she said. “Most people perceive fraud as a big issue but what they might consider fraud - people receiving benefits when they have the ability to work - is often just abuse of the system by taking advantage of certain rules and structures that allow people who can perform some work to nevertheless receive benefits.”
What constitutes abuse of the rules? An example, she said, would be claiming SSDI and receiving unemployment benefits at the same time, or claiming based on the argument that a disability prevents a worker from performing certain types of jobs.
Greszler and other SSDI critics often point to the rise of SSDI applications and award grants coincident with the rise of unemployment during the Great Recession as evidence of abuse. Some academic research has been done suggesting a cause-and-effect related to the unemployment rates, but this is hardly a settled matter among experts on SSDI.
Heritage has a broader agenda for SSDI reform. This week, it released a paper outlining 16 reforms aimed at improving the program’s solvency and integrity. (herit.ag/2FEBLDF) It includes the plan to use social media surveillance in eligibility determinations, tighter eligibility definitions and replacement of SSDI's progressive benefit formula with a ""flat anti-poverty benefit."" It also urges greater use of private disability insurance, especially among higher-income workers.
This agenda draws its fuel from the fraud and abuse arguments. So any debate about reforms should also include rebalancing our perspective on where the problems are in SSDI - and where they are not.",[]
1044,"Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders disagreed in a Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday over whether he once told her a woman could not win the White House in 2020, underlining an emerging rift between the progressive contenders as the first voting nears.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-debate/sanders-warren-spar-over-disputed-remark-about-chances-of-a-woman-defeating-trump-idUSKBN1ZD19Y?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews,reuters,gender,center,53,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"DES MOINES, Iowa (Reuters) - Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders disagreed in a Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday over whether he once told her a woman could not win the White House in 2020, underlining an emerging rift between the progressive contenders as the first voting nears.
After days of tensions between the two U.S. senators, friends and liberal standard-bearers, who agreed early in the campaign not to attack each other, Sanders emphatically denied he ever made the remark, saying it was “incomprehensible” he could have said such a thing in a private 2018 meeting with her.
Warren confirmed the comment and said she disagreed with Sanders, but quickly pivoted to the broader question of whether a woman could be elected president.
“Bernie is my friend and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie. But look, this question about whether or not a woman can be president has been raised and it’s time for us to attack it head-on,” Warren said.
The dispute brought questions about gender, sexism and electability back into the spotlight in the campaign, almost four years after Democrat Hillary Clinton failed in her bid to become the first woman president, in an upset loss to Republican Donald Trump.
With only three weeks until the crucial, first-in-the-nation Feb. 3 nominating contest in Iowa, the sprawling field of 12 Democratic candidates is still struggling to convince voters desperate to oust Trump in November’s election which one of them is best positioned to do so.
The race remains fluid, with opinion polls showing the top four contenders – former Vice President Joe Biden, Sanders, Warren, and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg in an extremely tight race.
Warren pointed out the men on the stage had collectively lost 10 elections, while the two women on the stage – she and U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar – had won each election they had contested.
“I have won every race, every place, every time, I have won in the reddest of districts, I have won in the suburban areas, in the rural areas,” Klobuchar said, pointing to the 2018 election of women governors in conservative states as further evidence a woman can win the White House this year.
After the debate, Warren appeared to refuse to shake hands with Sanders when he extended his hand as the candidates mingled on the stage. The two had a brief discussion that appeared tense until it was interrupted by candidate Tom Steyer.
Asked on CNN about the moment, Steyer said: “I felt like, OK, there’s something going on here. Good night, I’m out of here. It was one of those awkward moments where I felt like, OK, I need to move on as fast as possible.”
The flap between the two progressives allowed the front-running Biden, who has shown new signs of competitiveness in the two early nominating states of Iowa and New Hampshire, to stay largely above the fray.
SANDERS IN SPOTLIGHT
Sanders came under the most fire during the party’s seventh debate after rising to the top of some polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Democratic 2020 U.S. presidential candidates (L-R) Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) speaks with Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) as billionaire activist Tom Steyer listens after the seventh Democratic 2020 presidential debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, U.S., January 14, 2020.
In addition to his exchange with Warren, he was peppered with criticism for his opposition to free-trade pacts and on how he would pay for his costly Medicare for All plan, which would all but eliminate private health insurance in exchange for a single-payer government program.
“I don’t know that there’s any trade agreement that the senator would ever think made any sense.” Biden said.
In the discussion on healthcare, U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar noted that over two-thirds of Senate Democrats had not signed on to Sanders’ Medicare for All legislation.
“The debate isn’t real,” she said.
In the first debate since a U.S. air strike killed an Iranian military commander, elevating foreign policy concerns, Sanders also sparred with Biden over U.S. military interventions in the Middle East.
Sanders, a longtime antiwar advocate who voted against the 2002 authorization of war in Iraq, criticized Biden for supporting that conflict and said they both heard the same arguments from officials in former President George W. Bush’s administration before coming to different conclusions.
“I thought they were lying, I did not believe them for a moment,” Sanders said. “I did everything I could to prevent that war. Joe saw things differently.”
Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who touts his security credentials, acknowledged the vote “was a big, big mistake” and said that as President Barack Obama’s vice president, he worked to bring the troops home.

“It was a mistake to trust that they weren’t going to go to war,” Biden said of the Bush administration. “It was a mistaken vote, but I think my record overall on everything we have done, I’m prepared to compare it to anybody’s on this stage.”
The Iowa debate came just days before the expected start of a U.S. Senate trial to determine if Trump should be removed from office on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemming from his request that Ukraine investigate Biden.
Three of the Democrats in the debate who serve in the Senate - Sanders, Warren and Klobuchar - will sit as jurors in the impeachment trial, taking them off the campaign trail at a critical time. They said they did not mind.
“Some things are more important than politics,” Warren said, adding the trial would show the “corruption of this administration.”",[]
1052,Gun-control activists have reported a growing number of online death threats as lawmakers have passed gun control legislation ahead of the rally.,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guns-rally/ahead-of-tinder-box-virginia-gun-rally-trump-says-constitution-under-attack-idUSKBN1ZH09W?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews,reuters,gun-control,center,53,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"(Reuters) - Virginia’s House Republican leader said on Saturday that white supremacists and any other groups trying to spread “hate, violence, or civil unrest” were not welcome at a pro-gun rally in the state’s capital on Monday, which is expected to draw thousands.
The House Republican leader’s statement came a day after the state’s top court upheld a ban by the governor on weapons in the area around the Capitol in Richmond where the rally is set to take place by demonstrators protesting against Democrats’ push to stiffen the state’s gun laws.
“Any group that comes to Richmond to spread white supremacist garbage, or any other form of hate, violence, or civil unrest isn’t welcome here,” House Republican leader Todd Gilbert said in a statement. “While we and our Democratic colleagues may have differences, we are all Virginians and we will stand united in opposition to any threats of violence or civil unrest from any quarter.”
Militias, neo-Nazis and other groups have vowed to attend the rally. Authorities say they are expecting several thousand people and are trying to keep the event from becoming violent.
Virginia Governor Ralph Northam on Wednesday temporarily banned all weapons from the area around the Capitol ahead of the demonstration to avoid a repeat of violence that erupted at a 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, when a march by white nationalists led to the death of a counter-protester.
In a statement late Friday, the Virginia Citizens Defense League, a pro-gun rights group organizing the rally, urged 10,000 people to go to the Capitol grounds unarmed on Monday in accordance with the governor’s ban.
The emailed statement also called on tens of thousands more to stand with their weapons immediately outside the designated rally grounds to show support for Americans’ right to bear arms under the U.S. Constitution.
“For every one gun owner on the Capitol grounds, we need another two to five people outside,” the organizers wrote. “Those doing so can be legally armed.”
President Donald Trump backed the rally organizers in a Twitter post on Friday in which he said the U.S. Constitution was under attack by recent gun control measures in Virginia, a state that Hilary Clinton won in 2016 and where Democrats took full control of the state legislature for the first time in a generation in November.
“Your 2nd Amendment is under very serious attack in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia,” Trump wrote in the post, referring to the amendment in the Bill of Rights that gives Americans the right to keep and bear firearms. “That’s what happens when you vote for Democrats, they will take your guns away.”
The Virginia Senate late on Thursday passed bills to require background checks on all firearms sales, limit handgun purchases to one a month, and restore local governments’ right to ban weapons from public buildings and other venues.
Both Virginia legislative houses are also expected to pass “red flag” laws that would allow courts and local law enforcement to remove guns from people deemed a risk to communities, among other measures.
Gun-control activists have reported a growing number of online death threats as lawmakers have passed gun control legislation ahead of the rally.

Supporters of more restrictive gun laws say they would help decrease the number of people killed by firearms in the United States each year. Gun-rights activists assert that the constitution guarantees their right to possess any firearm.
On Thursday, the FBI arrested three members of a small neo-Nazi group who authorities said hoped to ignite a race war through violence at the Richmond rally, reminiscent of a 2017 white supremacist rally in nearby Charlottesville.
That rally proved a critical moment in the rise of the “alt-right,” a loose alignment of fringe groups centered on white nationalism and emboldened by Trump’s 2016 election. Trump was criticized from the left and right for initially saying there were “fine people on both sides” of the dispute between neo-Nazis and their opponents at the rally.",[]
1055,"As more and more South Koreans were released from treatment for COVID-19, authorities discovered a disturbing trend. Some ostensibly cured patients were later testing positive again.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-southkorea-explain/explainer-south-korean-findings-suggest-reinfected-coronavirus-cases-are-false-positives-idUSKBN22J0HR?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews,reuters,coronavirus,center,53,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean health authorities raised new concerns about the novel coronavirus after reporting last month that dozens of patients who had recovered from the illness later tested positive again.
The findings suggested that some people who survived COVID-19 could become reinfected with the virus that causes it, potentially complicating efforts to lift quarantine restrictions and to produce a vaccine.
But after weeks of research, they now say that such test results appear to be “false positives” caused by lingering - but likely not infectious - bits of the virus.
South Korea had reported more than 350 such cases as of Wednesday, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).
WHAT IS HAPPENING?
As more and more South Koreans were released from treatment for COVID-19, authorities discovered a disturbing trend. Some ostensibly cured patients were later testing positive again.
While officials examined several possible explanations, including reinfection of patients, or reactivation of the virus, an expert panel convened by the government concluded last week that the most likely explanation was that the tests are returning “false positives”.
South Korea uses reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, which detect the coronavirus’s genetic material.
The RT-PCR process can quickly return results and is considered the most accurate way to find out if a patient is infected with the coronavirus.
But in some cases, the tests may detect old particles of the virus, which may no longer pose a significant threat to the patient or others, said Seol Dai-wu, an expert in vaccine development at Seoul’s Chung-Ang University.
“The RT-PCR machine itself cannot distinguish an infectious viral particle versus a non-infectious virus particle, as the test simply detects any viral component,” Seol said.
This so-called false positive result is likely behind the cases of recovered patients testing positive again, the KCDC says.
Authorities are still gathering evidence to support their theory that the particles are from “dead” virus cells, KCDC director Jeong Eun-kyeong said on Wednesday.
The patients were retested after they either exhibited new respiratory symptoms, or were selected for retesting by authorities.
Less than half of those retested by mid-April were showing symptoms, according to the KCDC, but authorities now say it is unlikely that those symptoms were being caused by the virus.
ARE THE PATIENTS STILL INFECTIOUS?
Patients who tested positive for the new coronavirus after recovering from COVID-19 do not appear to be infectious.
The KCDC has not found a single case where such patients had passed the coronavirus to another person, Jeong said.
When investigating people who appear to suffer a relapse of symptoms after recovering from COVID-19, the KCDC takes cultures of the virus, a process that takes more than two weeks before reliable results become evident.
All 29 completed culture tests as of Wednesday had come back negative. At least 79 are being processed.
“The virus in the relapse cases have little to no infectiousness,” Jeong said.

Oh Myoung-don, a doctor at Seoul National University Hospital who is leading the panel of experts investigating the cases, said unlike hepatitis B or human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), coronavirus does not infiltrate into the host cell’s nucleus.
That means it does not cause chronic infection and chances of it reactivating are very low, he said at a briefing last week.
Authorities are also conducting tests to detect the presence of any antibodies that may have developed to fight the virus, and are testing and monitoring people who came into contact with the patients.",[]

Northam, who is leading the push for stronger gun laws in his state, said he wants to avoid a repeat of violence that erupted at a 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, when a march by white nationalists erupted and led to the death of a counterprotester.
Gun-rights advocates, including militia groups and ultraconservative activists, are planning a “Lobby Day” rally on Monday, seeking to block gun control legislation backed by Northam, a Democrat, whose party recently won majorities in both chambers of the state legislature.
“We’re seeing threats of violence. We’re seeing threats of armed confrontation and assault on our capitol,” Northam said. “These are considered credible, serious threats from our law enforcement agencies.”
Several measures - including universal background checks and “red flag” laws - that would toughen gun laws in the state are quickly making their way through the Senate and House, and could be passed before the end of the month.
The Virginia Citizens Defense League, which is organizing the rally, hopes that a large turnout by gun-rights proponents, most of whom will be openly carrying weapons as allowed by state law, will persuade lawmakers not to back the measures, according to materials posted online by the group.
“A substantial crowd will be here in Richmond,” State Police Superintendent Colonel Gary Settle told reporters on Wednesday. “We’re talking several thousands of people.”
Everyone attending Monday’s rally will be required to enter through a security checkpoint, authorities said.
Last week, Virginia lawmakers approved a new gun policy prohibiting firearms inside the Capitol and a nearby office building. But they did not extend the ban to Capitol Square, the public space outside that includes monuments to prominent Virginians and the Virginia Civil Rights Memorial.",[]

The deepening economic crisis triggered by nationwide lockdowns to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus was underscored by other data on Thursday showing worker productivity fell at its fastest pace in more than four years in the first quarter amid the largest drop in hours since 2009.
The reports support economists’ expectations of a slow rebound in the economy after gross domestic product slumped in the first quarter at the steepest pace since the 2007-09 Great Recession. The economic rout could hurt President Donald Trump’s bid for a second term in the White House in November’s election.
Trump wants the country to reopen and restrictions imposed by states and local governments to control the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, eased.
“The U.S. labor market is in the worst position since the Great Depression and is unlikely to improve sustainably anytime soon,” said Ron Temple, head of U.S. equities at Lazard Asset Management in New York. “Premature efforts to reopen economies undermine our progress in controlling the pandemic and risk extending the duration of the downturn.”
Initial jobless claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 3.169 million for the week ended May 2. Data for the prior week was revised to show 7,000 more applications received than previously reported, taking the tally for that period to 3.846 million. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 3.0 million claims for the latest week.
It was the fifth straight weekly decrease in applications since the record 6.867 million in the week ended March 28. Florida accounted for about 40% of the decline in claims last week, which some economists attributed to difficulties processing applications. There were also big drops in filings in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Alabama, New York and Washington state.
Still, the latest numbers lifted to about 33.5 million the number of people who have filed claims for unemployment benefits since March 21, equivalent to roughly one out of every five workers losing their job in just over a month.
“The pace of new claims for unemployment is slowing, but remains at levels unimaginable just a few months ago,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. “Even with the economy slowly starting to reopen, the number of unemployed should continue to rise sharply as governments, as well as businesses that have tried but not succeeded at holding the line, are now laying off workers.”
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, decreased at a 2.5% annualized rate in the first quarter. That was the largest decline since the fourth quarter of 2015 and followed a 1.2% pace of increase in the fourth quarter.
Hours worked tumbled at a 3.8% rate last quarter, the sharpest decline since the third quarter of 2009. Hours worked increased at a 1.2% rate in the fourth quarter.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as investors focused on a surprise rise in Chinese exports and a surge in oil prices. The dollar .DXY firmed against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
EMPLOYMENT REPORT AWAITED
Thursday’s weekly claims data will have no impact on the Labor Department’s comprehensive employment report for April, which is scheduled to be released on Friday, as it falls outside the period during which the government surveyed establishments and households for its monthly report. A survey on Wednesday showed private payrolls fell by a record 20.2 million in April.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls are forecast to have plunged by a historic 22 million in April, which would blow away the record dive of 800,000 seen during the 2007-2009 recession. Employment dropped by 701,000 jobs in March, ending a record streak of gains dating to September 2010.
The unemployment rate is seen jumping to 16% in April, which would shatter the post-World War Two record of 10.8% touched in November 1982. The jobless rate in March shot up 0.9 percentage point to 4.4%, the largest monthly change since January 1975.
April could, however, mark the trough in job losses as more small businesses access their portion of an almost $3 trillion fiscal package, which made provisions for them to get loans that could be partially forgiven if they were used for employee salaries. At least 30 states are partially reopening, which could see some of the unemployed going back to work.
“We lost a lot of jobs all at once, but we will be regaining a lot of jobs all at once too as large companies reopen,” Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia said on Fox Business Network.

The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid surged 4.636 million to a record 22.647 million in the week ended April 25. The so-called continuing claims data is reported with a one-week lag and will be closely watched in the coming months to get a better sense of the depth of the labor market downturn.
The Labor Department also reported that nearly a million people had their applications for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) processed in the week ending April 18.
The PUA program covers gig workers and many others who do not qualify for regular insurance unemployment, but have been forced out of work because of COVID-19. Another 1.4 million workers have sought benefits under this program since April 18.",[]

1076,The United Nations Humanitarian Affairs office warned on Monday that nearly a million Syrian civilians from northwest Idlib province had been displaced in a Russia-backed offensive there by dictator Bashar al-Assad that began in December.,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/m-blC792hwU/,breitbart,international-politics-and-world-news,right,54,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"The United Nations Humanitarian Affairs office warned on Monday that nearly a million Syrian civilians from northwest Idlib province had been displaced in a Russia-backed offensive there by dictator Bashar al-Assad that began in December.
Idlib is the last stronghold of the anti-Assad rebel movement in the country. Assad has been at war with the rebels since 2011 and has been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons against civilians and other human rights atrocities to cement his control over regions that oppose his rule. Conversely, rebel groups have faced allegations that they have cooperated with Sunni jihadist organizations, as the anti-Assad movement largely consists of Arab Sunnis opposed to the Shiite Alawite rule in Damascus.
While the struggle between Assad and Sunni rebels lies at the heart of the Syrian Civil War, as many as ten different factions have participated in violence in the country during the war, often unrelated to Assad such as the failed establishment of the Islamic State caliphate in Raqqa or clashes between the northern Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG/YPJ) and the Turkish military. Turkey claims to oppose Assad’s rule but has instead focused its energy on fighting the Kurds, who have not had any significant interaction with Assad’s army and instead largely contributed to the demise of ISIS.
The vacuum left by the fall of ISIS in the country has allowed Assad, along with allies Iran and Russia, to focus on attacking Idlib.
“The violence in north-west Syria is indiscriminate,” Mark Lowcock, U.N. Humanitarian Affairs chief, said on Monday. “We are now receiving reports that settlements for displaced people are being hit, resulting in deaths, injuries and further displacement.”
Refugees from the region “are traumatized and forced to sleep outside in freezing temperatures because camps are full,” he noted. “Mothers are burning plastic to keep children warm … babies and small children are dying because of the cold.”
Lowcock added that schools, hospitals, and other critical infrastructure has been destroyed. Exposure to nature while fleeing also leaves open the potential of a significant public health crisis in the event of disease spreading, he added.
He estimated that 900,000 people had been displaced since December 1. A week ago, the number of displaced in the region stood at 690,000 since December 1, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which estimated it was the largest number of displaced people in a single period of the Syrian Civil War. The sum is particularly jarring given that the U.N. estimates the Idlib region is home to 3 million people.
Lowcock urged U.N. Security Council action and a ceasefire to protect civilians.
Anadolu Agency, the state news agency of anti-Assad Turkey, claimed this week that the number was much higher – nearly 2 million displaced from Idlib since January. Anadolu claimed that rebels and Assad troops had declared a ceasefire recently that Assad had not respected; President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has threatened more military action against Assad in the near future.
As of this week, the United Nations estimates that over 5.6 million people have left Syria since the war began in 2011. Another 6.6 million are internally displaced, meaning they have lost their homes to the war and are either living homeless in cities or living in overcrowded refugee camps. The vast majority of those, over 3 million, who have left the country have fled to Turkey. Others in the new wave of displaced have fled to Manbij, Syrian Kurdistan. Local forces affiliated with the Kurdish fighters there have reported numbers too large to count of incoming refugees this month.
The Russian government has previously responded to United Nations reports on its atrocities in Syria by dismissing their information as false.
“They say the particular date a school or a hospital was destroyed in a particular region. They give coordinates. Our people start to double-check this and they find that there is no hospital with such coordinates, there is no school with such coordinates and the day which is mentioned by the U.N. humanitarian agencies, on this day, the Russian air force did not act at all,” Russian United Nations representative Gennady Gatilov complained in August, in response to yet another U.N. report accusing Moscow of helping Assad attack civilians. Gatilov claimed that biased NGOs on the ground provided the U.N. with misinformation.
This week, Russia has focused instead of accusing the United States of human rights violations.
“The oil fields … are controlled by the U.S. There’s shameless, impudent pillage of the wealth that belongs to Syria and the Syrian people taking place,” Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu claimed in Rome this week, referring to territories liberated from the Islamic State and managed by Syrian Kurdish groups.
The Assad regime’s state propaganda outlet, the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), claimed that, rather than terrorizing civilians, Assad has instead created a “humanitarian corridor” in Idlib for those who wish to leave.
“SANA reporter said that tens of citizens, most of them women, children, and elderly persons, exited through the humanitarian corridor established by the Syrian Arab Army west the liberated city of Ma’arat al-Nu’man, coming from the areas where the terrorists are positioned,” the outlet reported. SANA uses the term “liberated” to refer to cities under Assad control.
SANA also claimed Assad was providing medicine and food.

1083,"Mafia exploitation of immigrants on farms in Italy is likely to rise as the coronavirus lockdown brings chronic labor shortages, the government and labor rights groups have warned.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-italy-slavery-trfn/italys-lockdown-labor-crunch-sparks-fears-of-mafia-exploitation-idUSKBN2222MO,reuters,coronavirus,center,55,1,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"ROME (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Mafia exploitation of immigrants on farms in Italy is likely to rise as the coronavirus lockdown brings chronic labor shortages, the government and labor rights groups have warned.
Italy normally depends on 370,000 foreign workers to bring in its harvest, but travel restrictions to stop the spread of the virus have made that impossible, jeopardizing a quarter of its produce, according to farmers’ association Coldiretti.
That has led to fears that gangs could exploit undocumented migrants already in the country for cheap labor, an established but illegal practice known as “caporalato” that one United Nations expert has called a form of modern slavery.
“In this moment ... it can be easy for the mafia to use some people in Italy, like migrants without documents, to make them work (in farms),” said Carmelo Troccoli, a director at Coldiretti, Italy’s largest farming association.
“We are strongly fighting against this type of crime in Italy because it touches all farmers - in the south, in the center and in the north,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Troccoli was referring to Italy’s agricultural mafia, organized crime groups that Coldiretti has said set crop prices, manage transport, control entire supermarket chains and have an annual turnover of 24.5 billion euros ($26.65 billion).
Italy is home to more than 600,000 undocumented, mostly African migrants, who are vulnerable to such exploitation, according to agriculture minister Teresa Bellanova, who has proposed regularizing some to allow them to work legally.
Because they do not have the legal right to live and work in Italy, many are reluctant to turn to authorities for help.
If the state failed to take responsibility for these people, organized crime would step in, Bellanova told Italy’s Senate last week.
Earlier this month, more than a dozen non-governmental and religious organizations including Action Aid and Caritas Italiana made a similar call.
Under the caporalato system, which has been going for decades in Italy, migrants work long hours for wages below the national minimum and are subjected to violence, said Italy’s farmers’ union in 2018.
Such conditions are akin “to those of modern slavery”, said Hilal Elver, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to food, after her visit to Italy in January 2020.
Roberto Caponi, director of labor and welfare policies in Italian agricultural association Confagricoltura said the shortage of labor should be filled through unemployed Italians and opening corridors with Eastern Europe.
Both Coldiretti and Confagricoltura have set up online platforms to match job-seekers to local farms.",['exploitation']

Bloomberg, a billionaire and former mayor of New York, is a late entry to the race and is mounting an unconventional campaign, skipping the early nomination contests while spending hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising.
While public opinion polls have shown him trailing Democratic frontrunners in the nomination process, they also show his support is rising as he prepares to compete in the 14 states holding nomination contests on March 3.
Spencer, who announced his backing for Bloomberg at a campaign event in Norfolk, Virginia, did not criticize Republican President Donald Trump by name.
But, introducing Bloomberg at the event, Spencer said America needed “a steady hand at the wheel” who appreciated the strengths of U.S. allies and who respected different opinions.
He called Bloomberg “the best leader available.”
“He is the candidate the United States needs,” Spencer said.
Trump, who is running for re-election in November, tapped Spencer to be the Navy’s top civilian in June 2017.
But last year Spencer was fired because of conflicts within the Trump administration over his handling of the case of a Navy SEAL who was convicted of battlefield misconduct.
Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher was convicted by a military jury for illegally posing for pictures with the corpse of an Islamic State fighter. However, he was acquitted of murder in the detainee’s death and cleared of charges that he deliberately fired on unarmed civilians.
While Gallagher avoided a prison sentence, he was demoted in rank and pay grade for his conviction. The Navy informed Gallagher that a five-member panel of Navy commandos would review his case to determine whether he would be fit to remain on the elite force.
Trump intervened in the case, ordering the Navy to restore Gallagher’s rank and pay, and lashed out at the proceedings in a post on Twitter. He later said Gallagher would “retire peacefully with all of the honors that he has earned.”
Critics said at the time that Trump’s actions would undermine military justice and implicitly condone war crimes.

(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said on Monday that the wealthy, including himself, are not paying enough taxes.
“The wealthy are definitely undertaxed relative to the general population,” Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, told CNBC television on Monday.
“As we get more specialized, the rich will get richer,” he continued. “The question is: ‘How do you take care of a guy who is a wonderful citizen whose father died in Normandy and just doesn’t have market skills?’ I think the income tax credit is the best way to address that.”
“That probably means more taxes for guys like me, and I’m fine with it,” he said.
Buffett, 88, spoke after Charlie Munger, his 95-year-old business partner and Berkshire vice chairman, told CNBC earlier this month that states like California and Connecticut have been “stupid” for driving rich people away.
After regaining control of the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections, some Democratic lawmakers have been calling for higher taxes on the wealthy.

Putin, who has aligned himself with the Russian Orthodox Church and sought to distance Russia from liberal Western values, has proposed a shake-up of Russia’s political system that critics say may be designed to extend his grip on power after 2024, when he is due to leave the Kremlin.
He and his supporters see that overhaul as an opportunity to modify the constitution to enshrine what they see as Russia’s core moral and geopolitical values for future generations.
Putin on Monday submitted his constitutional proposals to parliament just before the deadline, RIA cited Pyotr Tolstoy, deputy chairman of the lower house, as saying.
“For me, the most important one is his proposal to enshrine in basic law the concept of marriage as a union between a man and a woman,” Tolstoy added.
Putin said last month Russia would not legalize gay marriage as long as he was in the Kremlin. He said he would not let the traditional notion of a mother and father be subverted by what he called “parent number 1” and “parent number 2”.

1118," Democracy probably cannot survive, after all, if one of our two major political parties is indifferent to its fate.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/07/how-far-will-republicans-go-to-destroy-democracy/#.XSY6699P5zg.twitter,alternet,gun-control,left,56,1,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Even before the latest Supreme Court decisions approving hyper-partisan gerrymandering and effectively allowing the addition of a citizenship question to the census, experts have wondered aloud whether Republicans remain committed to democracy. Toward the end of a recent plenary panel on Supreme Court reform at the American Constitution Society’s national convention, University of Chicago law professor Aziz Huq suggested, “We don’t really know how committed the Republican Party is to the project of democracy.”
If the GOP still values the rule of law, then perhaps the danger to democracy will recede after President Trump leaves office. But if the GOP no longer cares about democracy, then our political system could be in peril. Democracy probably cannot survive, after all, if one of our two major political parties is indifferent to its fate.
Unfortunately, the answer to Huq’s question is clear. The Republican Party is not at all committed to democracy, and GOP leaders and voters would happily tolerate alternative political arrangements. That is a worrisome claim, to be sure, but the evidence is indisputable. Republicans have abandoned any concerns they may have had for the integrity of our political system.
First, as is well understood, the GOP spent the past generation undermining the foundations of democracy — free and fair elections — so as to reinforce white rule. Thanks to the GOP’s commitment to voter suppression, paired with decades of phony rhetoric about voter fraud, millions of black and brown Americans have no access to the ballot box. Due to the Supreme Court’s evisceration of campaign finance law, unlimited and unaccountable dark money floods our politics.
Sophisticated redistricting software enables Republicans to force Democrats to waste millions of votes, leading to highly skewed electoral outcomes. These decades-long assaults required systematically coordinated tactics, such as the 50-year campaign that led to the Supreme Court’s dismantling of the Voting Rights Act. The evisceration of democracy is no accident.
Second, the GOP is structurally committed to lying. “Structurally committed” means that party leaders have little if any choice in the matter. They have to lie. And this has nothing to do with Donald Trump. One of the first things that Newt Gingrich’s Republican House majority did upon assuming power in 1995 was to undermine evidence-based policy by killing the Office of Technology Assessment and slashing the funding of the Congressional Research Service and Government Accountability Office.
Why? Republicans must disavow factual evidence because neither wing of the party (the corporate wing or the resentment wing) can tell the truth about what it stands for. The corporate wing cannot admit that it cares exclusively about tax cuts for the rich and corporate deregulation, so it has to lie about what it does. That’s why the 2002 handout to oil, gas and coal companies was called the “Clear Skies Initiative.” That’s why the 2009-2010 health care debate was framed in terms of “death panels,”as if private insurance does not ration care. That’s why the 2017 tax cut for corporations and elites was sold as a middle-class tax cut.
Nor can the resentment wing of the GOP speak honestly about the paranoid basis of its preferences. (Interestingly, Donald Trump occasionally comes close, such as when he refers to Mexicans as “rapists.”) Gun enthusiasts cannot admit that they like firearms because they fear black people. “Pro-lifers” cannot admit that they oppose abortion because they are afraid of what would happen if women controlled their bodies. (If they truly supported life, after all, they would fight climate change).
Anti-statists (of the Ruby Ridge or “Oregon standoff” variety) cannot admit that they oppose the public sector because they think government programs are for black people. Xenophobes cannot admit that they oppose immigration because they think brown people are dirty. (How often do you hear them oppose illegal immigration from Canada?) Religious extremists cannot admit that they oppose feminism and LGBTQ people because they are afraid of out-of-control sex. Neither the capitalist nor the resentment wing of the GOP can tell the truth, and that’s why the party is structurally committed to lying. As historian Timothy Snyder has explained, when a political party becomes unmoored from fact, anything is possible.
Third, the GOP has paved the way for the collapse of civilization due to climate change. While it is difficult, psychologically, to confront what’s at stake, some experts have concluded that we have already passed the point at which the collapse of humanity is inevitable, and that civilizational collapse will occur soon. The GOP, of course, has resisted mitigation of the climate crisis for decades. Even the most despicable regimes on earth, such as Syria’s, have signed onto the Paris agreement, but the GOP continues to do everything in its power to obstruct even modest reforms. The collapse of civilization will be worse than genocide, yet the GOP is happy to enable it. If a political party is willing to facilitate an outcome worse than genocide, then why would it oppose authoritarianism? The answer is that it would not.
President Trump, of course, poses an extreme threat to the rule of law. But President Trump is not the root of the problem. Nor is the GOP’s willingness to destroy “democratic norms” the root of the problem. Both Trump and GOP norm-breaking are symptoms, not causes. The root of the Republican radicalism is the triangular relationship among capital (e.g., the Koch brothers), the right-wing media (e.g., Fox News), and resentment voters (whom Hillary Clinton accurately labeled “deplorables”), the latter being the roughly 40 percent of the public who still believe Trump is doing a good job.
Long after Trump leaves the scene, Fox News will continue to manufacture paranoia to motivate resentment voters to vote for capitalists who will head to Washington to lower taxes, deregulate the economy and undermine democracy. The GOP’s capital wing cares about tax cuts and deregulation and, thanks to Fox News, has an unlimited capacity to manufacture paranoia. Its resentment wing cares about making scapegoats suffer, and has an unlimited capacity for consuming paranoia. Neither wing cares about anything else. Not fairness. Not national interest. Not democracy. Not the rule of law. From this perspective, Trump’s presidency is a gift that exposes how the machinery of the GOP works and what’s at stake in its operation.
Many progressives entertain a fantasy that the GOP can be de-radicalized at the ballot box. After all, only 40 percent of the electorate supports Trump. Crooked Media’s Jon Lovett summarized this view before last year’s midterms: “There is only one thing we can do, which is stamp out this form of Republicanism, defeat it completely and govern without them until they learn that there’s a price to be paid for the kind of politics they’ve practiced.”
Unfortunately, however, the GOP cannot be de-radicalized at the ballot box. Democrats already thrashed the GOP in wave elections in 1992, 2006, 2008 and 2018, yet after each election, the Republican Party became even more radical. After its 2012 defeat, the GOP even concluded in a self-administered autopsy that it needed to de-radicalize — and then lined up behind Trump just a few years later.
Even the most mild-mannered Republican, such as Sen. Susan Collins of Maine or former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, must govern, once in office, as a radical, no matter how sweet their smile or how gentle their manner. They are just as captured by the triangular relationship between capital, right-wing media and resentment as their more explicitly frothy colleagues. Brett Kavanaugh, after all, hails from the genteel, country club wing of the GOP, yet it took no time at all for him to unveil his radicalism, in both style and substance, at his confirmation hearing.",['survive']
1125,"Two years after filling the streets of U.S. cities to protest the start of Donald Trump’s presidency, women will march again this weekend to try to build political pressure against him ahead of the 2020 elections.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-women/in-third-year-u-s-womens-marches-turn-to-2020-elections-idUSKCN1PB2KH,reuters,gender,center,57,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two years after filling the streets of U.S. cities to protest the start of Donald Trump’s presidency, women will march again this weekend to try to build political pressure against him ahead of the 2020 elections.
The loose movement around the marches has splintered as it enters its third year, and one of the various groups now involved has faced criticism it is anti-Semitic, which it denies. But leaders of the groups say momentum has not slowed, and the rallies will celebrate unprecedented gains for women in congressional and state races in last year’s midterm elections.
Millions of people took part in the women’s marches in Washington and other cities in the United States and abroad on Jan. 21, 2017, the day after the Republican president was sworn in.
Vanessa Wruble, a co-founder of the original Women’s March on Washington who left to start March On, a separate grassroots coalition, said the movement has evolved from being a reaction to Trump’s presidency.
It was “essentially the resistance movement, and now you see the movement being far more proactive,” she said.
Women’s March, a national nonprofit organization that evolved from the initial Washington march, is using its #WomensWave marches in Washington and elsewhere on Saturday to roll out a 10-part policy platform that includes raising the federal minimum wage and protecting reproductive rights.
“Women are just not on the agenda in this current administration,” Women’s March Chief Operating Officer Rachel Carmona said.
March On will kick off an initiative to mobilize women voters by hosting a “March on the Polls 2020” on Saturday in dozens of cities, including Boston and Denver.
Dozens of like-minded organizations will host training sessions for activists and prospective candidates.
More than 400 women have applied to attend a candidate training session this weekend in Washington hosted by Emily’s List, an organization that works to elect women who support abortion rights, said spokeswoman Tonya Williams.
Wruble said the 2018 elections showed the movement had “shifted the balance of power” in American politics. More women were elected to the U.S. Congress than ever before and many of the new Democratic women lawmakers cited Trump’s presidency among the reasons they decided to run for office.

Of course, women are not all united around the same causes. The annual “March for Life” by anti-abortion campaigners, which takes place in Washington on Friday, is a movement of people who broadly embrace Trump and Republicans.
GRASS-ROOTS EFFORTS
At the outset, March On was bankrolled by leaders covering expenses out of pocket, but it raised a “sizeable” amount of money in 2018 and aims to raise $2 million in 2019, Wruble said.
March On distributes funds to local affiliates for on-the-ground planning, provides design assistance for websites and logos and gives access to a public relations firm. In February and March, the group’s leaders will meet with affiliates to determine how best to support their efforts over the next election cycle.
“This year is really going to be about increasing our tool chest of what we offer to them,” said March On’s Natalie Sanchez, an organizer of the 2017 Boston Women’s March who is also with March Forward Massachusetts, which is leading Saturday’s march there.
The Women’s March now counts national progressive groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Move On among its partners. March On partners include the ACLU, Rock the Vote and Emerge America, which recruits Democratic women to run for office.
Women’s March’s Carmona said she spends 60 hours a week on planning calls, including “chapter” calls with 30 to 45 local organizations. The group did a 10-state tour ahead of last year’s congressional elections and is developing a nationwide strategy that would train more local leaders ahead of the 2020 presidential contest, she said.
There have been growing pains in a movement that grew out of hundreds of loosely affiliated marches in 2017.
In cities such as New York, there will be multiple events on Saturday hosted by different organizations, largely due to calls by some religious leaders to boycott Women’s March over criticism that some of its leaders are anti-Semitic.
Women’s March leader Linda Sarsour issued a statement condemning all forms of anti-Semitism and bigotry. Leaders Tamika Mallory and Bob Bland reiterated on ABC’s talk show program “The View” this week that they were committed to a movement that fought all forms of oppression.
Leaders of Women’s March and March On insist the divisions are not a weakness.

“I know there have been controversies this year and rifts and divides and those may or may not affect numbers on particular marches, but I haven’t seen that have any effect on the movement’s strength over all,” Wruble said.
Carmona said “there is a role for everyone” no matter which group they join, adding decentralized movements had a kind of power that is “hard to strike at.”",[]

Authorities in Muslim-majority Malaysia, which has reported 149 infections of the virus, are tracking about 5,000 citizens who took part in the Feb. 28-March 1 gathering of Islamic missionaries at a mosque in the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur.
“All mass gatherings should be postponed to minimise the spread of COVID-19,” the health ministry said on Twitter, referring to the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Eleven of the cases linked to the meeting have cropped up in people in Brunei who attended the meeting - Brunei’s first cases of the coronavirus. Some 90 people from Brunei attended.

Putin, who has aligned himself with the Russian Orthodox Church and sought to distance Russia from liberal Western values, has proposed a shake-up of Russia’s political system that critics say may be designed to extend his grip on power after 2024, when he is due to leave the Kremlin.

Putin on Monday submitted his constitutional proposals to parliament just before the deadline, RIA cited Pyotr Tolstoy, deputy chairman of the lower house, as saying.

The Senate Judiciary Committee voted against Northam's bill that would make it a felony to ""recklessly leave a loaded, unsecured firearm” in a way that endangers a minor.
“This bill will keep children safe from loaded, unsecured firearms. Like Gov. Northam’s other commonsense gun safety measures, it is something that everyone -- including responsible gun owners -- should support,” said Northam’s spokeswoman, Alena Yarmosky.

The bill is one of eight the Northam has proposed for adoption, drawing the ire of gun-rights activists nationwide.
Two Democrats -- state Sens. Creigh Deeds and Chap Petersen -- joined with Republicans to defeat the measure. They cited concerns that law-abiding gun owners would be unfairly punished.
Another measure that would ban so-called assault weapons like AR-15 rifles is also in danger of falling short. Some of Northam's gun control measures have passed in the state's Democratic-controlled General Assembly and lawmakers will hash out the differences between both chambers in the coming weeks.
Some of the bills include limiting handgun purchases to once a month; universal background checks on gun purchases; and a red flag bill that would allow authorities to temporarily take guns away from anyone deemed to be dangerous to themselves or others.
Guns have been at the forefront of Virginia politics following a mass shooting in Virginia Beach last year that ended with a dozen people dead.

The Republican president, who is expected to be acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate, says he is innocent of the charges.
Here is the Democrats’ case for removing Trump from office, and the Republican counter-argument.
THE CHARGES
In their articles of impeachment here , Democrats charge that Trump abused his power as president by pressuring the government of Ukraine to help him win re-election. They accuse the president of endangering the U.S. Constitution, jeopardizing national security and undermining the integrity of the 2020 election.
They also charge Trump with obstruction of Congress for refusing to turn over records they requested as part of the impeachment probe launched in September and ordering members of his administration not to testify.
They say Trump must be removed from office to protect national security and preserve the country’s system of government.
THE EVIDENCE
At the heart of the impeachment case is a transcript of a July 25 telephone call in which Trump pressed Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to work with U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to launch a corruption investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, a top contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.
Trump also asked Zelenskiy to look into a debunked theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 presidential election.
The allegations by Trump allies against Biden - that he used his position to force the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor in order to stop an investigation of an energy company of which his son Hunter was a director - have been discredited. Neither Trump nor his allies have provided evidence to support them, and Biden has denied them.
Current and former U.S. government officials testified during the inquiry that Trump directed them to work with Giuliani, even though the former New York mayor had no official government position.
Some witnesses said they believed that Trump withheld nearly $400 million in security aid, as well as the prospect of a high-profile White House meeting, to pressure Zelenskiy to announce the investigations. Trump’s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, also told reporters that the White House withheld the money.
The U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, provided some of the most damaging testimony here before the House Intelligence Committee. He said he spoke directly with Trump about the effort to pressure Ukraine and said other top administration officials were involved. He testified that Ukrainian officials understood they would have to announce the investigations in order to receive the withheld security aid.
Trump ultimately released the money after news of the delay became public. He has yet to invite Zelenskiy to the White House.
OTHER EVIDENCE
Other evidence has emerged since House Democrats wrapped up their inquiry and voted to impeach Trump in December.
Internal government communications released through open-records requests show White House officials told the Pentagon that Trump had directed them to hold back the aid to Ukraine.
The Government Accountability Office, a non-partisan congressional watchdog, said Trump broke the law by refusing to spend money that had been approved by Congress.
One of Giuliani’s former associates, Florida businessman Lev Parnas, last week provided phone messages and other evidence to the Intelligence Committee that detailed efforts by him and Giuliani to pressure Kiev.
REPUBLICANS
Trump says he has done nothing wrong, and his Republican allies in the House agree with him - not a single one voted for either of the two articles of impeachment.
Trump's legal team argues here that neither of the charges amounts to an impeachable offense, or even a crime, because the president has the right to decide how to conduct foreign policy and what materials to share with Congress.
They say Trump was within his rights to ask Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens as part of a broad anti-corruption drive.
They also say Trump has the right to resist congressional demands for information.
Republican lawmakers say the Democrats’ case for impeachment amounts to hearsay because it relies mostly on the testimony of mid-level officials who did not deal directly with Trump.
They say Democrats should have gone to court to force the testimony of senior officials who were directly involved in the matter after Trump ordered them not to cooperate - a process that could have taken months.
One official who could provide an eyewitness account, former national security adviser John Bolton, refused to participate in the House inquiry but said he is willing to testify in the Senate trial. It is unclear whether Republicans, who control the chamber, will agree to let him do so.
Republicans also say no actual exchange of favors took place because Zelenskiy ultimately did receive the delayed aid - as well as a meeting with Trump, although that was on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and not at the White House - without agreeing to the investigations Trump wanted.
They argue that Democrats are subverting the will of voters who elected Trump president in 2016 because they do not like him or his policies, and turning the impeachment process into a partisan tool.",[]
1187,"The normalization effort included softened rhetoric and social gatherings that, for many groups, would increasingly replace confrontational rallies.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-white-nationalism-insight/el-paso-massacre-upends-white-nationalists-normalization-strategy-idUSKCN1UY2B5,reuters,white-nationalism,center,60,1,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"RUSSELLVILLE, ARK. (Reuters) - Two years ago, America’s white nationalist movement stunned the country. Neo-Nazi demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, had turned deadly when a far-right protester drove a car through a crowd, killing one and injuring dozens. Some movement leaders regrouped. Instead of stoking outrage, they set out to build support with another tack: Looking normal.

The larger goal was what many white nationalists call “Phase 2” — gaining mainstream acceptance for far-right ideas widely rejected as repugnant and getting white nationalists into positions of influence. The normalization effort included softened rhetoric and social gatherings that, for many groups, would increasingly replace confrontational rallies.
“The strategy is internally focused now — having families get together,” said alt-right blogger Brad Griffin, a self-avowed white nationalist from Montgomery, Alabama. He fondly recalled a river-tubing trip he organized in 2018 for friends who had attended a local white nationalist conference. The goal of such low-key gatherings, he said, is to spread far-right ideology away from the public spectacle of a public protest. “It’s a lot more fun to do that than to go out and tangle with Antifa” — members of America’s far-left “anti-fascist” movement — “and get hit with piss balloons in the street.”
(INTERACTIVE: tmsnrt.rs/2MXA7kL)
Griffin spoke in an interview before last weekend’s massacre in El Paso, Texas — an event that has scrambled the calculus for the movement’s aspiring normalizers.
On Saturday, authorities say, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius shot and killed 22 people and wounded two dozen more shortly after a manifesto appeared online explaining his motivation and decrying a “Hispanic invasion” of the United States.
The El Paso attack has also put new pressure on a man some white nationalists praise as helping advance their movement: Donald Trump. The U.S. president has come under sustained criticism for his racially incendiary rhetoric since launching his candidacy in 2015 — including his repeated use of the word “invasion” to describe immigration along the U.S.-Mexico border.
On Monday, Trump issued his most forceful disavowal of white supremacism to date. “In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy,” Trump said in response to the weekend’s shootings. “These sinister ideologies must be defeated.”
After Charlottesville, the lie-low approach was seen as a necessity by some in the movement. Many white nationalist groups were sued and lost access to social media, which has caused them to avoid public confrontations, said Heidi Beirich, who studies far-right groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit civil rights organization that tracks extremists.
“We haven’t seen many rallies since Charlottesville,” she said. The combination of bad press, prosecutions and lost access to social media, has “depressed people in the movement” and created a sense that “maybe the softer approach is the way to go.”
The shootings, and Trump’s repudiation, leave the normalizers in a difficult, perhaps impossible spot. Their gambit was always a stretch.
A Reuters photojournalist has observed the approach up close — at a children’s nursery in a “church” run by the Ku Klux Klan (KKK); a restaurant-and-bar that caters to white supremacists in Georgia; a barbecue held in Arkansas by the ShieldWall Network, a self-avowed neo-Nazi group with dozens of members. Even as they described their hopes of mainstreaming, many members of these and other groups also voiced the violent tropes that animate the movement.
(WIDER IMAGE photo essay: reut.rs/2KnI80l )
One is the so-called Great Replacement conspiracy theory, common in white nationalist circles, which holds that leftist elites are engineering the replacement of white majorities globally through policies that encourage mass migrations as white birth rates decline. The manifesto tied to the El Paso shooting referenced the replacement theory in explaining why the shooter chose to kill Hispanic people.
Asked in a May interview how whites could regain demographic dominance, ShieldWall’s leader, Billy Roper, told Reuters that promoting a higher birth rate among white people is helpful, but “bullets” would be faster. Roper said his organization doesn’t advocate anything illegal but that he “couldn’t disagree” with the goals of the mass shooter who murdered 51 people at two Muslim mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March. That killer, too, had cited the replacement theory as a motive.
In a phone interview after the Texas massacre, Roper said he didn’t support the killings. But the victims, Roper said, “were just pawns in the Jewish game of demographic replacement of whites,” adding that such “cultural conflicts” are an “unfortunate fact of modern life” in an increasingly diverse nation moving closer to racial “balkanization.”
The strategy of trying to couch such extreme views in mainstream rhetoric is not new. One of the highest-profile examples of the normalization tack is that of David Duke, a former KKK grand wizard who traded the klan’s signature white robes and pointy hats for a business suit, adopted more mainstream conservative talking points, and made the runoff election for Louisiana governor in 1991. Duke lost by a wide margin but drew support from about half the state’s white voters.
The normalization effort is also not universal. Some far-right groups are still known for confrontation, including the Proud Boys, who last October fought with people protesting a Republican Club event in New York City.
Members of the National Socialist Movement, a neo-Nazi group, carry guns and other weapons (left) as they gather in a parking lot before attending a rally at the state capitol in Little Rock, Arkansas, in November 2018. The group was protesting what it called the “white genocide” taking place in South Africa.
In Draketown, Georgia, Pat Lanzo runs a restaurant-and-bar that white supremacists have claimed as their own. Lanzo insists the Georgia Peach Oyster Bar is merely a celebration of free speech.
“We’re not racist,” he said. “We hate everyone equally.”
The decor inside his bar is filled with the kind of racist tropes that remain a hard sell with mainstream America. His menus feature a drawing of a Klan member relaxing on a hammock made of two lynched black corpses tied together at the feet. And Lanzo has rented his property to neo-Nazis and klan members for cross burnings, a traditional show of force by the KKK in the American South.
The image-scrubbing by today’s white nationalists belies a long history of violence by far-right ideologues. In the ten years ending in 2018, murderers motivated by far-right ideology took the lives of 124 people in 62 incidents, according to the U.S. Extremist Crime Database, a collaboration of criminal justice researchers from multiple universities. The statistics include white supremacists but also those with other far-right agendas that are not focused on race, such as anti-government militants.
Thomas Robb, the national director of The Knights Party, a group formerly named the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, said the movement should think beyond confrontations and rallies.
“When the rally’s over, what do you do?” said Robb in an interview before the El Paso shootings. “Our goal isn’t so much to get membership, but influence. When people come to our website, they see responsible people who aren’t using the ‘N word’ in every sentence.” Instead, Robb said, the aim is to “speak like Corporate America” as a way to make far-right ideas more palatable to a broader audience.
White nationalists have always debated whether putting “reasonable clothing” on their movement would get them further than street clashes and violence, said Mike German, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning policy institute. But the approach appears to have gained momentum under Trump in part because of the president’s racially divisive rhetoric, said German, who previously spent years undercover with white nationalists as an agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
“Before, white nationalists were trying to shove their way into the mainstream,” German said. “Now, they’re being invited in.”
It’s far from clear whether many true believers are ready for life in the mainstream.
This past April in Russellville, Arkansas, a lakeside college town, three members of the ShieldWall Network gathered to rent a houseboat and cruise around Lake Dardanelle. A Reuters photojournalist went with them.
Moods were light; they toasted one another with Fireball whiskey shots, laughed when one of them dropped his phone in the lake and cooed as another cuddled with his pregnant wife. Later that night, the group would initiate a new recruit, Nicholas Holloway, and burn wooden swastikas.
Two months later, in June, Holloway and two other ShieldWall members on the boat that day — Julian Calfy and John Carollo — were arrested for allegedly beating a gay man and holding a gun to his head after luring him to Calfy’s home with a false dating advertisement, according to police reports. Calfy remains in jail, while the other two members are free on bail, according to a spokesman for the Pope County, Arkansas, Sheriff’s Office. Each is charged with third-degree battery, first-degree terroristic threatening and first-degree criminal mischief in connection with the attack.
Neither the defendants nor their attorneys could be reached for comment.

Griffin, the alt-right blogger, condemned the El Paso shooting in stronger terms than other extremists who spoke to Reuters, calling it and other mass shootings by avowed white nationalists “insane tragedies.”
At the same time, Griffin said he supported resegregation of the races, echoing one of the core principles of the manifesto that authorities tied to the Texas shooter.
The continuing violence, he said, undermines any attempt by the movement to gain more mainstream acceptance. At this point, he said, most white nationalists would rather just “stay out of the debate.”","['normalization', 'softened', 'confrontational']"

1190,"Haqqani claimed the Taliban are just looking for a round of free and fair elections, laughably pretending the murderous Islamist extremists would cheerfully accept losing and head back to their caves in peace if the Afghan people reject them.",http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/EReXUAKj_UQ/,breitbart,international-politics-and-world-news,right,60,1,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The New York Times on Thursday published an op-ed written by Sirajuddin Haqqani, deputy leader of the Taliban and a globally designated terrorist with a $5 million FBI reward on his head.
Haqqani used the opportunity extended by the Times to recite Taliban propaganda and lay out the terrorist organization’s terms for peace in Afghanistan.
The FBI wants Haqqani for “questioning in connection with the January 2008 attack on a hotel in Kabul, Afghanistan, that killed six people, including an American citizen.” He is also wanted for participating in attacks on U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan and planning the attempted assassination of former Afghan President Hamid Karzai in 2008.
Haqqani is not only deputy commander of the Taliban but also the operational commander of the Haqqani Network, the infamous criminal gang and internationally designated terrorist organization allied with the Taliban that is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks and kidnappings, including U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl. Sirajuddin Haqqani’s father Jalaluddin, founder of the network, died after a long illness several years ago.
The New York Times did not see fit to provide any of this background information to readers, identifying Sirajuddin Haqqani as merely “deputy leader of the Taliban.”
In his op-ed, Haqqani portrayed the Taliban as reasonable negotiators appalled by the loss of life in Afghanistan, excusing his group’s atrocities and remorseless attacks on civilians as justified acts of self-defense. He blamed the United States for undermining previous efforts at working out a peace deal.
“We did not choose our war with the foreign coalition led by the United States. We were forced to defend ourselves. The withdrawal of foreign forces has been our first and foremost demand. That we today stand at the threshold of a peace agreement with the United States is no small milestone,” Haqqani wrote.
The terrorist leader claimed that his side stuck with the current round of negotiations despite “the intensified bombing campaign against our villages by the United States and the flip-flopping and ever-moving goal posts of the American side.”
Haqqani claimed the Taliban are just looking for a round of free and fair elections, laughably pretending the murderous Islamist extremists would cheerfully accept losing and head back to their caves in peace if the Afghan people reject them:
We are aware of the concerns and questions in and outside Afghanistan about the kind of government we would have after the foreign troops withdraw. My response to such concerns is that it will depend on a consensus among Afghans. We should not let our worries get in the way of a process of genuine discussion and deliberation free for the first time from foreign domination and interference. It is important that no one front-loads this process with predetermined outcomes and preconditions. We are committed to working with other parties in a consultative manner of genuine respect to agree on a new, inclusive political system in which the voice of every Afghan is reflected and where no Afghan feels excluded. I am confident that, liberated from foreign domination and interference, we together will find a way to build an Islamic system in which all Afghans have equal rights, where the rights of women that are granted by Islam — from the right to education to the right to work — are protected, and where merit is the basis for equal opportunity.
This would be the same Taliban that gleefully murders young women for the crime of going to school and regards democracy as a crime against Islam punishable by death.
Haqqani claimed concerns about the Taliban allowing Afghanistan to be used as a staging ground for international terrorist organizations are “politically motivated exaggerations by the warmongering players on all sides of the war” and pledged to “take all measures in partnership with other Afghans to make sure the new Afghanistan is a bastion of stability and that nobody feels threatened on our soil.”
“We are ready to work on the basis of mutual respect with our international partners on long-term peace-building and reconstruction. After the United States withdraws its troops, it can play a constructive role in the postwar development and reconstruction of Afghanistan,” he wrote.
The bottom line, laid out at the end of Haqqani’s op-ed, is that the United States is clearly interested in ending its nearly two-decade involvement in Afghanistan’s endless bloodshed, and the Taliban wants the U.S. to depart badly enough to make a few immediate practical concessions plus a few long-term rhetorical concessions that everyone will pretend to believe until American troops are gone:
We are about to sign an agreement with the United States and we are fully committed to carrying out its every single provision, in letter and spirit. Achieving the potential of the agreement, ensuring its success and earning lasting peace will depend on an equally scrupulous observance by the United States of each of its commitments. Only then can we have complete trust and lay the foundation for cooperation — or even a partnership — in the future. My fellow Afghans will soon celebrate this historic agreement. Once it is entirely fulfilled, Afghans will see the departure of all foreign troops. As we arrive at this milestone, I believe it is not a distant dream that we will soon see the day when we will come together with all our Afghan brothers and sisters, start moving toward lasting peace and lay the foundation of a new Afghanistan. We would then celebrate a new beginning that invites all our compatriots to return from their exile to our country — to our shared home where everybody would have the right to live with dignity, in peace.
The tragedy of America’s 18 years in Afghanistan has been a stubborn refusal to admit the Afghan government is incapable of standing on its own, no matter how much money is poured into it, how much training its troops are given, or how many of its battles American soldiers fight. There is not much left to do except hope the Afghans rise to the occasion and hold the Taliban to some of the promises it is making.
The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) argued in August that Sirajuddin Haqqani’s position in both terrorist groups made him the man the Trump administration needed to talk to, in order to hammer out a workable exit plan from Afghanistan.
Among other factors, CFR noted the Haqqani Network is a more potent international terror threat than the Taliban and more interested in “international jihad,” while the Taliban is more focused on regaining control of Afghanistan. Haqqani’s patronage is also vital to the survival of jihadi groups in Pakistan and expanding jihad franchises beyond the Middle East.
CFR quoted the assessment of Gen. John R. Allen, former commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan, saying, “Although many Jihadi groups are sending their rank and file to places like Syria, few of these groups have the close relations with al Qaeda, media savvy, military capability, and technical expertise for suicide attacks like the Haqqani network.” For example, not many other jihad groups are media-savvy enough to get op-eds published in the New York Times without any mention of the outstanding FBI warrants for their arrest.","['murderous', 'extremists', 'pretending', 'laughably', 'caves']"
1193,The case was sent back to lower courts to determine whether the gun owners may seek damages or press claims that the amended law still infringes their rights. ,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-guns/u-s-supreme-court-sidesteps-major-gun-rights-ruling-but-more-cases-loom-idUSKCN22920S,reuters,gun-control,center,60,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a National Rifle Association-backed challenge to New York City restrictions on handgun owners transporting their firearms outside the home, avoiding for now the battle over the scope of the right to bear arms under the U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment.
There are other cases pending that could give the court’s conservative majority a chance to widen gun rights including challenges to assault weapon bans in Massachusetts and Cook County, Illinois, and permit requirements to carry firearms outside the home in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Maryland. The justices are set to discuss privately on Friday whether to take up these cases.
The justices in an unsigned decision threw out the New York dispute because the measure that was challenged by individual gun owners and the state’s affiliate of the influential NRA was rolled back by the city last July, rendering the case moot.
The case was sent back to lower courts to determine whether the gun owners may seek damages or press claims that the amended law still infringes their rights. Justice Samuel Alito, in a dissent joined by fellow conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, said the case was not moot and that the city’s law violated the Second Amendment.
Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, while agreeing that the current dispute is moot, said in a concurring opinion that the court “should address that issue soon.”
New York City and an array of groups that support gun safety laws applauded the court’s action.
“The court’s resolution was supported by plain common sense, the facts and the law,” said James Johnson, the city’s corporation counsel.
President Donald Trump’s administration had supported the handgun owners and the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association in the case. The NRA is a powerful lobby group closely aligned with U.S. conservatives and Republicans including Trump.
‘WRONGDOING AND RETREAT’
Jason Ouimet, executive director of the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, said the high court had “accepted New York’s surrender” and that concerns among the justices “about Second Amendment infringements are real.”
“Because this lawsuit was necessary to force the government’s admission of wrongdoing and retreat, the NRA will continue these battles across America,” Ouimet said.
Gun control proponents had feared that the justices would use the case to expand gun rights by either extending the right to possess firearms for self-defense beyond the home or by creating a strict standard that would force lower courts to cast a skeptical eye on new or existing gun control laws.
Such a ruling could have threatened gun control measures nationwide such as expanded background checks for gun buyers and “red flag” laws targeting the firearms of people deemed dangerous by the courts, according to these advocates.
“Today’s decision rejects the NRA’s invitation to use a moot case to enact its extreme agenda aimed at gutting gun safety laws supported by a majority of Americans,” said Hannah Shearer, litigation director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.
The case focused on New York City’s handgun “premises” licenses that allowed holders to transport their firearms only to a handful of shooting ranges within the city and to hunting areas in the state during designated hunting seasons.

The issue of gun rights is contentious in the United States, where numerous mass shootings in recent decades have prompted calls from many Americans for stricter regulation of firearms and ammunition. Citing the Second Amendment, the NRA and its allies have resisted most gun control measures.
The Manhattan-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the regulation advanced the city’s interest in protecting public safety and did not violate the Second Amendment, prompting the appeal to the high court.
Alito wrote that gun safety reasons given by the city were dubious and that there is “cause for concern” over how lower courts are applying the Supreme Court’s 2008 precedent recognizing that the Second Amendment protects a person’s right to keep a gun at home for self-defense. The justices in 2010 extended that decision to the states.",[]

FILE PHOTO A sign is seen on the entrance to a Social Security office in New York City, U.S., July 16, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo
The 2020 Social Security and Medicare trustees reports released on Wednesday did not reflect projections from the coronavirus pandemic but showed continued long-term funding shortfalls for retirement, disability and seniors’ healthcare benefits.
Social Security, which pays retirement, survivor and disability benefits, can pay full scheduled benefits until 2035, the same year as projected in last year’s report. Medicare’s Hospital Insurance Trust Fund can pay scheduled in-patient hospital expenses until 2026, also the same as in last year’s report.
Trump administration officials said that while they have made no official projections on the effects of the virus, if a 15% reduction in employment and revenues persists over the full 2020 year, they expect those depletion dates will move forward.
For Social Security, that drop in revenue, assuming a return to normal employment levels in 2021, would move forward the reserves depletion date by six months to mid-2034, the officials said.
A worse-case scenario of a second year of a 15% reduction could push the Social Security depletion into 2033, the officials said.
Medicare, the healthcare program for older Americans, could face both a revenue hit and a significant increase in hospitalization costs, and the reckoning for trust fund depletion could come considerably sooner.
Under a “high-cost” scenario, the Medicare hospital trust fund would be depleted in 2023.
“It is also possible that the experience could be even worse than that,” one of the administration officials told reporters on a conference call. “It truly is too early to say exactly what the impacts are. But you are correct in that they are generally going to be worse than presented under the immediate assumptions.”
Depletion of Social Security and Medicare reserves does not mean that benefits stop altogether, because there is an assumption that tax revenues will continue to be collected. Under the current pre-pandemic projections, continuing tax revenues would allow Social Security to pay 79% of scheduled benefits in 2035 and Medicare could pay 90% of total hospital insurance benefits in 2026.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement that the programs, which make up the federal government’s two largest expenditures, “remain secure,” but added that the Trump administration was “working around the clock” to mitigate long-term negative economic impacts from the pandemic.",[]

The National Society for Human Rights (NSHR) did not name 18-year-old Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, who grabbed international attention after barricading herself in a Bangkok airport hotel room and appealing for help on Twitter to resist being sent back to her family, which denies any abuse.
But in a statement late on Sunday NSHR head Mufleh al-Qahtani accused unspecified countries and international organizations of pursuing political agendas and “pushing (women) ultimately to be lost and maybe to fall into the arms of brokers and human traffickers”.
While NSHR says it is independent, the U.S. State Department describes it as “government-funded”.
Riyadh’s human rights record has been in the spotlight since the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at its Istanbul consulate in October. There has also been growing international criticism of the Saudi-led coalition’s air strikes in Yemen that have caused heavy civilian casualties including children.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in Riyadh on Monday, said he spoke with Saudi leaders about Yemen, Khashoggi and other human rights issues.
NSHR “was surprised by some countries’ incitement of some Saudi female delinquents to rebel against the values of their families and push them out of the country and seek to receive them under the pretext of granting them asylum,” Qahtani said.
He did not name Canada or Australia, which also considered offering Qunun asylum, or the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which granted her refugee status.
Qunun arrived in Toronto on Saturday, wearing a hoodie emblazoned with the word Canada, and a cap bearing the UNHCR logo. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland welcomed her at the airport, calling her “a very brave new Canadian.”
Canada’s move comes amid tension with Riyadh after Ottawa demanded the immediate release of jailed rights activists last year, prompting Saudi Arabia to expel its ambassador to Canada, recall Saudis living there and freeze new trade.
The case has also drawn attention to Saudi Arabia’s guardianship system, which requires women to have the permission of a male relative to travel, sometimes trapping them as prisoners of abusive families.
Qahtani said Saudi laws forbid mistreatment and allow women to report it, but international rights groups say in practice many Saudi women fear that going to the police would only further endanger their lives.",[]

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.
BERLIN — Berlin is trying to stop Washington from persuading a German company seeking a coronavirus vaccine to move its research to the United States, prompting German politicians to insist no country should have a monopoly on any future vaccine.
German government sources told Reuters on Sunday that the U.S. administration was looking into how it could gain access to a potential vaccine being developed by a German firm, CureVac.
Earlier, the Welt am Sonntag German newspaper reported that President Donald Trump had offered funds to lure CureVac to the United States, and the German government was making counter-offers to tempt it to stay.
""The German government is very interested in ensuring that vaccines and active substances against the new coronavirus are also developed in Germany and Europe,"" a Health Ministry spokeswoman said, confirming a quote in the newspaper.
""In this regard, the government is in intensive exchange with the company CureVac,"" she added.
A senior American official later said the Welt report was wrong.
""Not true. The Welt story was wrong,"" said Richard Grenell, acting Director of National Intelligence and the U.S. Ambassador to Germany, referring to the newspaper report.
""Now everyone is back peddling,"" he added on Twitter.

A German Economy Ministry spokeswoman also said Berlin ""has a great interest"" in producing vaccines in Germany and Europe.
She declined to comment on any takeover possibilities but referred to Germany's foreign trade law, under which Berlin can examine takeover bids from non-EU, so-called third countries ""if national or European security interests are at stake.""
In a statement issued Sunday, the company said it ""rejects current rumors of an acquisition.""
The statement added that while it was in contact with ""authorities worldwide,"" it ""abstains from commenting on speculations and rejects allegations about offers for acquisition of the company or its technology.""
A spokesperson for CureVac also denied the report. ""To make it clear again on coronavirus: CureVac has not received from the U.S. government or related entities an offer before, during and since the Task Force meeting in the White House on March 2. CureVac rejects all allegations from press,"" the spokesperson said.
Florian von der Muelbe, CureVac's chief production officer and co-founder, told Reuters last week the company had started with a multitude of coronavirus vaccine candidates and was now selecting the two best to go into clinical trials.
The privately-held company based in Tuebingen, Germany, hopes to have an experimental vaccine ready by June or July to then seek the go-ahead from regulators for testing on humans.
On its website, CureVac said CEO Daniel Menichella early this month met with Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force and senior representatives of pharmaceutical and biotech companies to discuss a vaccine.
Karl Lauterbach, a professor of health economics and epidemiology who is also a senior lawmaker with Germany's Social Democrats, tweeted in reaction to the Welt am Sonntag report: ""The exclusive sale of a possible vaccine to the USA must be prevented by all means. Capitalism has limits.""
CureVac in 2015 and 2018 secured financial backing for development projects from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, working on shots to prevent malaria and influenza.
In the field of so-called mRNA therapeutics, CureVac competes with U.S. biotech firm Moderna and German rival BioNTech, which Pfizer has identified as a potential collaboration partner.
Drugs based on mRNA provide a type of genetic blueprint that can be injected into the body to instruct cells to produce the desired therapeutic proteins. That contrasts with the conventional approach of making these proteins in labs and bio-reactors.
In the case of vaccines, the mRNA prompts body cells to produce so-called antigens, the tell-tale molecules on the surface of viruses, that spur the immune system into action.
Companies working on other coronavirus-vaccine approaches include Johnson & Johnson and INOVIO Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The Republican president, who is expected to be acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate, says he is innocent of the charges.
Here is the Democrats’ case for removing Trump from office, and the Republican counter-argument.
THE CHARGES
In their articles of impeachment here , Democrats charge that Trump abused his power as president by pressuring the government of Ukraine to help him win re-election. They accuse the president of endangering the U.S. Constitution, jeopardizing national security and undermining the integrity of the 2020 election.
They also charge Trump with obstruction of Congress for refusing to turn over records they requested as part of the impeachment probe launched in September and ordering members of his administration not to testify.
They say Trump must be removed from office to protect national security and preserve the country’s system of government.
THE EVIDENCE
At the heart of the impeachment case is a transcript of a July 25 telephone call in which Trump pressed Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to work with U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to launch a corruption investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, a top contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.
Trump also asked Zelenskiy to look into a debunked theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 presidential election.
The allegations by Trump allies against Biden - that he used his position to force the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor in order to stop an investigation of an energy company of which his son Hunter was a director - have been discredited. Neither Trump nor his allies have provided evidence to support them, and Biden has denied them.
Current and former U.S. government officials testified during the inquiry that Trump directed them to work with Giuliani, even though the former New York mayor had no official government position.
Some witnesses said they believed that Trump withheld nearly $400 million in security aid, as well as the prospect of a high-profile White House meeting, to pressure Zelenskiy to announce the investigations. Trump’s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, also told reporters that the White House withheld the money.
The U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, provided some of the most damaging testimony here before the House Intelligence Committee. He said he spoke directly with Trump about the effort to pressure Ukraine and said other top administration officials were involved. He testified that Ukrainian officials understood they would have to announce the investigations in order to receive the withheld security aid.
Trump ultimately released the money after news of the delay became public. He has yet to invite Zelenskiy to the White House.
OTHER EVIDENCE
Other evidence has emerged since House Democrats wrapped up their inquiry and voted to impeach Trump in December.
Internal government communications released through open-records requests show White House officials told the Pentagon that Trump had directed them to hold back the aid to Ukraine.
The Government Accountability Office, a non-partisan congressional watchdog, said Trump broke the law by refusing to spend money that had been approved by Congress.
One of Giuliani’s former associates, Florida businessman Lev Parnas, last week provided phone messages and other evidence to the Intelligence Committee that detailed efforts by him and Giuliani to pressure Kiev.
REPUBLICANS
Trump says he has done nothing wrong, and his Republican allies in the House agree with him - not a single one voted for either of the two articles of impeachment.
Trump's legal team argues here that neither of the charges amounts to an impeachable offense, or even a crime, because the president has the right to decide how to conduct foreign policy and what materials to share with Congress.
They say Trump was within his rights to ask Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens as part of a broad anti-corruption drive.
They also say Trump has the right to resist congressional demands for information.
Republican lawmakers say the Democrats’ case for impeachment amounts to hearsay because it relies mostly on the testimony of mid-level officials who did not deal directly with Trump.
They say Democrats should have gone to court to force the testimony of senior officials who were directly involved in the matter after Trump ordered them not to cooperate - a process that could have taken months.
One official who could provide an eyewitness account, former national security adviser John Bolton, refused to participate in the House inquiry but said he is willing to testify in the Senate trial. It is unclear whether Republicans, who control the chamber, will agree to let him do so.
Republicans also say no actual exchange of favors took place because Zelenskiy ultimately did receive the delayed aid - as well as a meeting with Trump, although that was on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and not at the White House - without agreeing to the investigations Trump wanted.
They argue that Democrats are subverting the will of voters who elected Trump president in 2016 because they do not like him or his policies, and turning the impeachment process into a partisan tool.",['charge']

* Central bank suspended gold buying for its reserves on April 1
* Exports hit by grounded flights - lobby group
* Russian gold miners unmoved, bet on demand in London
By Elena Fabrichnaya and Polina Devitt
MOSCOW, April 7 (Reuters) - Russian banks have asked the central bank to resume buying gold for its reserves with exports of the precious metal hobbled by the coronavirus outbreak, their lobby group said.
The country is the world’s third largest gold producer after China and Australia but the almost global grounding of passenger flights, which were used to transport the metal, has meant that banks who buy from producers before selling the metal on have to switch to a decreasing number of more expensive cargo flights or build up inventory.
Russia’s central bank suspended gold purchases on the domestic market from April 1, without giving a reason. However, analysts have suggested it is focusing on foreign currency sales to support the rouble, which has fallen in line with lower oil prices as the virus spread.
Vasily Zablotsky, the head of the National Finance Association, a non-government lobby group of Russian banks, told Reuters that banks are “facing problems” exporting gold as there are also fewer cargo flights and transportation costs have doubled.
In this situation “banks will have to either refuse to buy gold from producers or to increase the amount in the vaults,” he said.
Russia’s central bank declined to comment on Tuesday but has said previously that a further decision on gold purchases would depend on how the situation on the financial markets develops.
Russia produced 10.1 million ounces (314 tonnes) of refined gold in 2019, of which 5.1 million ounces were bought by the central bank and 3.7 million ounces were exported mainly to Britain and Switzerland, the top markets for global gold trade.
The central bank reduced its gold purchases in 2019 to support exports but remained the largest buyer of gold produced in Russia. Its gold reserves stood at 73.6 million troy ounces with the value of $120 billion as of March 1.
The banks’ lobby group also plans to ask the central bank to start accepting gold pledged as collateral for the refinancing of banks’ debt and organise gold swap deals which provide rouble liquidity to the banking market, Zablotsky said.
Russian gold miners are relatively unscathed so far, hoping that demand for Russian bars will remain healthy in London due to a number of suspended refineries in Switzerland.
“I do not see any drama in this,” said a top-manager at one Russian gold miner.
However, bankers shared the concerns of their union.
“There is a bottleneck,” said a source at one of the top Russian banks in the gold trade. “Even with high fares, it is hard to find the aircrafts.”
An industry source said the bottleneck would likely become more noticeable throughout the entire trading chain in the next week or so with the back up spreading to the refineries.
“I can not imagine how they are going to untie this knot,” the source said. (Reporting by Elena Fabrichnaya and Polina Devitt; editing by Kirsten Donovan)",[]

In the past, Democrats have feared that supporting gun restrictions could cost them the backing of working-class, swing voters - the group widely credited with tipping the 2016 presidential contest to Republican Donald Trump.
After dozens of mass shootings in recent years, however, including at schools like the February 2018 massacre in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead, curbing gun violence has become a component of the Democratic policy platform embraced by congressional and presidential candidates.
“In my community, kids fear fireworks on the Fourth of July because they sound like gunshots,” Booker said of his hometown of Newark, New Jersey, in a news release. “In communities across the country, from Newark to Charlotte, from San Diego to Chicago, and everywhere in between, Americans are being killed and families are being torn apart. We must do better. We need to do better.”
Booker’s plan would also ban assault weapons; allow the Consumer Product Safety Commission to regulate gun manufacturers; require microstamping technology be incorporated into new models of semi-automatic handguns; calls for universal background checks for gun sales; and close the “boyfriend loophole” that allows dating partners to purchase firearms after being convicted of abuse or under a restraining order. Current and former spouses convicted of abuse or under a restraining order are prohibited from purchasing a firearm.
Most but not all components of Booker’s plan would require approval of the U.S. Congress. Democrats currently control the House of Representatives and Republicans the Senate, where gun safety legislation would likely meet intense pushback.
‘THE CENTER HAS SHIFTED’
“Today is more proof that the center has shifted on gun control,” Igor Volsky, founder of Guns Down America Action Fund, said in a statement. “Senator Booker has clearly listened to and heard from the majority of Americans that are crying out for a future with fewer guns. Fewer guns means safer communities.”
Senator Kamala Harris, another 2020 contender, said last month that she too would move quickly to curb gun violence if elected to the White House.
Harris said she would give Congress 100 days to pass gun-control legislation, such as a universal background checks bill or a renewal of the ban on assault weapons, before using presidential executive power to act on the issue.
Harris said she would use executive power to require sellers of five or more weapons a year to run background checks for all gun sales; revoke the license of gun manufacturers and dealers who break the law; reverse a move by Trump to redefine “fugitive from justice” that allowed those with outstanding arrest warrants to buy guns; and close the boyfriend loophole.
An assault weapons ban was enacted in 1994 during Bill Clinton’s presidency. It was among the reasons cited when Democrats lost congressional seats in the 1994 midterm elections. The ban expired in 2004.
In the 2004 presidential election, Democrat John Kerry did not make gun control a focus of his campaign and was photographed with a weapon on a hunting trip. Former President Barack Obama did not make guns a focus of his 2008 or 2012 campaigns. Hillary Clinton supported gun control measures during her 2016 campaign but did not emphasize them.
But gun-control advocates say the Parkland shooting and many others, including the Las Vegas concert shooting in 2017 that left 58 dead and hundreds more wounded, and another at an Orlando, Florida, nightclub in 2016 when 49 were killed have shifted public opinion on the issue.
Reuters/Ipsos polling in Feb. 2019 showed that 58 percent of Americans support policies that would make it more difficult to own a gun. About 69 percent said they strongly favored prohibiting individuals with a history of mental illness from buying a firearm. About 61 percent strongly or somewhat favored banning online sales of ammunition.

Supporting gun control measures did not hinder Democrats during the 2018 midterm congressional elections. Nearly 80 percent of the 62 newly elected Democrats included the issue in their campaign platforms. A Reuters analysis found the percentage far outstripped the proportion of Democratic candidates who did so during 2016 congressional elections.

The Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee focused on a bipartisan bill called the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, which would require background checks for all firearm sales and most firearm transfers. It has 230 House co-sponsors, including five Republicans.
“Despite the obvious need to address the source of gun violence, Congress, for too long, has done virtually nothing. But now, we begin a new chapter,” said Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat.
Democrats won control of the House in the November elections after eight years of Republican rule, partly because of public frustration over the inability of Congress to address a growing number of mass shootings at schools and other public venues.
Wednesday’s hearing took place a week ahead of the first anniversary of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which claimed the lives of 17 students and staff and launched a national youth movement that has reignited the long-running U.S. debate over gun rights.
But there was no sign that any gun legislation approved by the Democratic House majority would gain traction in the Republican-controlled Senate.
Witnesses at the hearing also called for legislation to address gun trafficking between states, a ban against assault rifles, the repeal of a federal law that protects the gun industry from lawsuits, and increased funding for federal officials charged with policing the flow of firearms across the country.
The U.S. Constitution protects the right of Americans to bear arms. The measure is fiercely defended by Republicans, who on Wednesday warned that new legislation could lead to a national gun registry and claimed that expanded background checks would not protect people from gun crime.
“The greatest cruelty in the world is to tell people you will help in their situation with legislation and then try to pass off legislation that would do nothing,” said Representative Doug Collins, the Judiciary Committee’s top Republican. “In legal terms, that’s called fraud.”
Witnesses said the legislation would close loopholes exploited by online gun dealers and those who purchase guns for others unwilling or unable to buy their own.
“This bill will definitely save lives,” Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo told lawmakers.
Of the close to 40,000 deaths from gun violence in 2017, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in December that 60 percent were self-inflicted.",[]

Leading a procession of 21 other women - from teenagers to senior citizens - to a chapel in the Songdhammakalyani monastery in Nakhon Pathom province, Boodsabann teared up as she prepared to exchange her white garments for the distinctive saffron robes otherwise seen almost exclusively on male monks.
“I’m going to overcome this obstacle and become ordained like I’ve always wanted,” the 49-year-old businesswoman said before the ceremony on Dec. 5, where she would have her head shaved. She stayed for nine days at the temple.

Officially, only men can become monks and novices in Thailand under a Buddhist order that since 1928 has forbidden the ordination of women. The country does not recognize female monks or novices.
One option for devout Thai women is to become white-clad Buddhist nuns, who follow a less-strict religious regimen than monks and are often relegated to housekeeping tasks in temples.
In recent years, more Thai Buddhist women seeking to become full-fledged “bhikkunis”, or female monks, have been defying the tradition by pursuing the other option: getting ordained overseas, usually in Sri Lanka or India.
Dhammananda Bhikkhuni, the 74-year-old abbess of the Songdhammakalyani monastery, flew to Sri Lanka to be ordained in 2001 as Thailand’s first female monk.
Since then, she has helped women like Boodsabann join the Buddhist order as novices at the monastery’s ordination ceremonies every April and December.
“It’s been 90 years and the social context has changed, but they still don’t accept us,” Dhammananda told Reuters in an interview at the temple’s library, where an entire shelf is dedicated to books about women’s rights and role in religion.
“It’s a shame that women aren’t allowed to make decisions for their own lives. You have to rebel against injustice because this is not right,” she added.
While Dhammananda’s monastery ordains female novices, it cannot do the same for those seeking to become female monks. Such a ceremony would require not only 10 female monks but also 10 male monks, who are forbidden under Thailand’s 1928 order to participate in it.
There are about 270 female monks across Thailand and they were all ordained abroad, Dhammananda said, adding that her monastery houses seven of them. In contrast, Thailand has more than 250,000 male monks.
Efforts in the past by advocates to undo the 1928 order have been futile. It has been officially upheld during meetings of the Sangha Supreme Council, the council of top monks, in 2002 and most recently in 2014.
The government says this is not gender discrimination but a matter of long-held tradition, and women are free to travel abroad to be ordained, just not in their own country.
“Women can’t be ordained here, but no one stops them from doing that overseas. They just can’t be ordained by Thai monks, that’s all,” said Narong Songarom, spokesman of the National Office of Buddhism.",[]

But voters in a town hall also pressed her on the impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, climate change and healthcare, enabling the first-term congresswoman to display her progressive credentials on a range of issues.
Ocasio-Cortez, 29, has soared to prominence since her election a year ago, pushing the Democratic Party to veer to the left ahead of the November 2020 presidential election while becoming a favorite target of conservative Fox News and Republicans who consider her too radical.
“If the government worked for us half as much as it works for billionaires and corporations, our lives would be transformed,” Ocasio-Cortez said before about 100 people at a public library in the borough of Queens.
She outlined an agenda that may find a path through the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives but would be sure to fail in the Republican-led Senate.
Her “Just Society” proposal, comprising five separate bills, offers plenty of ammunition for critics and admirers.
It would overhaul federal guidelines on the poverty line, now defined as an individual earning less than $13,064 each year or a family of four earning less than $25,465.
Ocasio-Cortez would identify far more people as impoverished and make them eligible for government benefits.
Other bills would steer federal contracts to companies that treat workers well, curb rent hikes by landlords, or restore rights to former convicts after they have completed jail terms.
One provision certain to spur supporters of Trump’s hardline immigration policies would extend federal benefits to undocumented immigrants.
Ocasio-Cortez told reporters afterward she had yet to fix a price tag to the proposal, but said some provisions would cost nothing and others would cut spending, for example, by reducing the jail population and lowering the cost of incarceration.
“This is a question that is only asked about the general welfare of the public and it’s not a question that we ask about war, it’s not a question that we ask about the $2.1-trillion GOP tax cut,” Ocasio-Cortez said.
“For those that may have a price tag attached to them, we’re happy to have that conversation,” she said, adding that the budget impact would be analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office.

1370,"Donald Trump, by design, is a chaos monster who shovels crap out faster than people can process it.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/trump-is-desperate-and-encouraging-violence-from-his-superfans/,alternet,gun-control,left,69,1,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Donald Trump, by design, is a chaos monster who shovels crap out faster than people can process it. Unencumbered by normal human qualities like empathy or conscience, Trump can bounce from one awful behavior from another — grifting, sexual assault and harassment, racism, lying, conspiracy-mongering, criminal schemes — with astonishing speed, doing more wicked deeds in a day that what most aspiring villains can accomplish in a year or even a lifetime.
In an effort to get a handle on the endless deluge of awfulness pouring out of Trump, it’s become common to describe some of the godawful things he does as “distractions” from other awful things he does. It’s an effort to triage our response, apparently on the theory that figuring out which Trump evils rank higher than others can somehow sharpen our efforts to process and resist them. It’s an honorable desire based in empirical evidence: Indeed, Trump sometimes does or says nasty things to divert public and media attention from other nasty things he does or says. Unfortunately, this often fails to understand that the nasty stuff Trump does to distract us from other nasty stuff is incredibly dangerous on its own terms, and can’t just be shrugged off as a pure or content-free distraction.
Today’s case in point: Trump, who has frequently indulged in late-night binges of Twitter vitriol while most Americans are asleep, was at it again late on Wednesday night when he decided to promote a video by a cowboy cosplayer and Trump superfan named Couy Griffin declaring, “The only good Democrat is a dead Democrat.”
“Thank you Cowboys. See you in New Mexico!” Trump said of the video, which echoed a 19th-century slogan — “the only good Indian is a dead Indian” — used to justify genocide against Native Americans.
So far, however, the mainstream media reaction has been a big, fat shrug. And it’s easy to see why. Indeed, it’s fair to argue that Trump’s trolling antics of late are an attempt to distract attention from the real-world disaster unfolding in this country, largely due to his negligence. The U.S. has officially crossed mark of 100,000 dead from COVID-19. More than 40 million people who have filed for unemployment. Trump has entirely given up on even pretending to have any national strategy for fighting the virus, beyond demanding that states “reopen” ASAP to let the virus wash over us and kill untold thousands more.
“This whole thing is a distraction, and you know it,” Chris Cuomo of CNN said on Wednesday night, adding that Trump stirs the pot with this hateful nonsense to distract “from the dead and the dire situation that [he’s] basically ignoring.”
On Thursday morning, MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, who has been fending off Trump’s vile and baseless murder accusations in recent weeks, made a similar point. Trump defames him and others, Scarborough said, to distract us from the fact that he ignored or neglected the coronavirus pandemic for months. He would rather have people “talk about how vile his tweets are or how dangerous his fight with Twitter is” than about the 100,000 dead.
Neither Cuomo nor Scarborough was talking specifically about Trump tweeting out violent rhetoric toward Democrats — Cuomo’s segment aired shortly bit before Trump did that — but about the mountainous garbage fire of the president’s Twitter feed in general, of which this threatening rhetoric was just a small piece. Trump is absolutely throwing out whatever he can in a desperate bid to regain control of the conversation so that his massive failures aren’t the focus. That’s led to at least two nights where he stayed up late and sent more than 100 tweets, in hopes of coughing up something outrageous enough to seize the headlines.
So it’s true that these things are blatant distractions. But it doesn’t follow that the best approach is necessarily to ignore Trump’s childish behavior. The fact the president of the United States is encouraging domestic terrorism against “Democrats” — not just against specific politicians, which would be bad enough, but against anyone who identifies as a Democrat — is not a small thing. On the contrary, it’s incredibly dangerous.
It wasn’t all that long ago, though it may seem like another epoch, when a domestic terrorist apparently set out to murder Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and the staffers at CNN — among others — with mail bombs, because he loved Trump so much. In fact, the president’s level of plausible deniability was higher then: That was before Trump had openly called for such violence. Now there’s an army of angry reactionaries with guns — whom Trump has eagerly encouraged with his “LIBERATE” tweets — who hang on his every word and appear ready to escalate to open armed insurrection. It’s undeniable that at least a few people, and perhaps more than that, will interpret this as a push to lash out with targeted violence in the middle of an election year. The only real question is how widespread that violence will be.
Let’s not fool ourselves here. In the video Trump tweeted, Griffin pivots from his incendiary language to claim that he only wishes Democrats dead “in a political sense.” This falls somewhere between legalistic ass-covering and standard-issue gaslighting, with Griffin trying to hoodwink people into ignoring what he said just moments before. He’s trying to have his right-wing shitposting cake and eat it too, openly encouraging violence while also trying to evade responsibility with digressive, rambling explanations of how you can’t believe he really means what he just said.
But Griffin means it, and Trump does too. As Will Sommer of The Daily Beast found when he interviewed Griffin, the guy does a piss-poor job at disguising his obvious longing for violent retribution against Democrats, who he believes have no legitimate claim to representation in politics.
“You get to pick your poison: you either go before a firing squad, or you get the end of the rope,” Griffin said of Democratic governors, right after claiming he wasn’t seriously proposing killing anyone. When asked whether anti-lockdown protesters were considering violence, Griffin said, “There’s not an option that’s not on the table.”
Like Donald Trump, Griffin’s an obvious coward who wants to push violent rhetoric but isn’t willing to face the consequences for doing so. By pushing Griffin’s speech, Trump is engaging in stochastic terrorism, in which a prominent voice puts out the suggestion of radical violence, but refuses to acknowledge any responsibility if and when someone else acts on it.
Trump is desperate and clinging to anything he can use, including threats of violence, to scare Democratic voters away from the polls in November. Since the presidential election is our last available mechanism to remove Trump and replace him with someone vaguely sane and competent, this is no small thing. In the age of the coronavirus, in fact, replacing Trump with someone competent is more important than ever. It’s quite literally the only hope this country has of saving lives and saving our economy.
There’s a way to call out Trump’s violent trolling while also keeping the focus on the rising numbers of dead and unemployed. It’s about going meta — pointing out not just the facts of Trump’s behavior, but why he’s doing the things he does.
That’s actually what Cuomo and Scarborough did in their TV segments, ironically enough. Neither man is actually ignoring Trump’s Twitter antics. They highlight that stuff while also explaining to viewers the not-so-hidden purpose of such trolling: Trying to divert attention away from the 100,000 dead and 40 million unemployed. Their segments are good examples of how to walk and chew gum at the same time. They’re not taking the “ignore his antics and he’ll go away” approach. Rather, they’re doing what all journalists should be doing, which is closer to a both/and approach — calling out Trump’s often violent and mendacious distractions while also highlighting the real toll of his leadership failures on the American people.
That’s what everyone in media should be doing. Ignoring Trump won’t make him go away. He is still president, unfortunately. He will always have a direct line to his followers, and now he’s using that connection to deliver unsubtle hints that they should use violence to prevent Democrats from voting him out of office. He’s also playing the same game with his false accusations against Scarborough, creating a permission structure for some lunatic with a gun who wants to avenge his orange godhead against the “fake news.”
Sadly, men with guns who want to hurt you isn’t a problem we can just ignore away.
We can focus instead not just on what Trump is doing but why he’s doing it. What: Using incendiary rhetoric in hopes of inspire his followers to take violent action on his behalf. Why: Because he’s becoming aware that, thanks to his massive failures as president, he probably can’t keep power through nonviolent and legal means. Donald Trump’s increasingly dangerous flirtation with using mob violence to subvert democracy isn’t a small story. It must be covered, but covered carefully — and always by pointing toward the dark goals he hopes to accomplish with this vile behavior.","['chaos', 'monster', 'shovels', 'crap']"

Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, is mounting a late challenge for the Democratic nomination, blanketing airwaves with television ads.
The candidate has quickly built a 1,000-person campaign staff while releasing progressive proposals, including a pledge on Wednesday to ban flavored e-cigarettes, but he trails Democratic frontrunners Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in polls. The Democratic nominee will face Republican President Donald Trump in the November election.
Dogging Bloomberg’s campaign are allegations that he made inappropriate comments toward women and that his company, Bloomberg LP, fostered a hostile environment for female employees.
“Did I ever tell a bawdy joke? Yeah, sure I did. And do I regret it? Yes. It’s embarrassing,” Bloomberg, 77, told ABC’s “The View.” “But, you know, that’s the way I grew up.”
Bloomberg did not reference specific jokes. ABC News reported in December that it obtained a copy of a 32-page booklet distributed at a party in 1990 that included sexist remarks by Bloomberg, reportedly compiled by his colleagues. The same report chronicled numerous discrimination lawsuits filed against Bloomberg LP over the last three decades.
In one notable instance, a saleswoman filed a lawsuit in 1997 alleging that when she told Bloomberg she was pregnant, his response was, “Kill it,” according to news reports at the time. Bloomberg at the time denied making the remark, and the lawsuit was settled.
Bloomberg said the company, a major provider of news and financial information to Wall Street, has “very few” cases of sexual harassment given its large size, and said he thinks “most people would say we’re a great place to work.”
He said the company would not release women from non-disclosure agreements that were part of legal settlements, some of which stemmed from allegations of sexual harassment by Bloomberg LP employees. One of Bloomberg’s rivals, Warren, a Democratic U.S. senator, has called on Bloomberg to release the women from the agreements.
In an ongoing case in New York, the plaintiff asked a judge in December to invalidate her agreement with Bloomberg LP as well as any signed by other people.
On Wednesday night, Bloomberg launched an outreach effort, “Women for Mike,” at a Manhattan hotel ballroom where he celebrated his victory in a mayoral race a decade ago.
A crowd that his campaign said topped 1,000 people swept up free wine, cheese and coin-sized hamburgers while Bloomberg’s longtime girlfriend Diana Taylor, “The Sopranos” actress Lorraine Bracco and a female campaign staffer endorsed Bloomberg.
“All of my success in life - everything I’ve done - is thanks to the strong women around me,” Bloomberg said, pivoting to his support for reproductive rights. “In many parts of this country, and certainly in Washington, women’s rights are under attack and so are women themselves.”
Women make up a larger share of the U.S. voting population than men and they report being less sure about which candidate they support in the Democratic presidential primary. About six in 10 women Democrats have a favorable impression of Bloomberg, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll last month, a lower share than several of Bloomberg’s opponents.","['Dogging', 'inappropriate']"

While all three major U.S. stock indexes ended the session solidly higher, they see-sawed for much of the day, with reopening state economies and the possibility of additional stimulus doing battle with revived trade war fears and bleak economic data.
“This market is a battle over time frames,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. “Those pushing the market up believe we’re going to get a vaccine in a reasonable amount of time, the economy isn’t totally going to fall apart, that unemployment is not going to spike appreciably higher.”
“On days when (the market is) pushed down, the naysayers come to the forefront, when it bounces back up the more optimistic investors see an opportunity,” Ghriskey added.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court struck down the governor’s lockdown orders, fueling hopes that mandated restrictions could be lifted sooner rather than later.
But an ousted health official testified before a U.S. House of Representatives panel that the United States could face “the darkest winter” if its response to the pandemic failed to improve.
Comments by Trump late Wednesday blamed China for the coronavirus outbreak and revived trade war fears, even as mandated lockdowns continue to damage the economy.
That damage was in evidence in a report from the U.S. Labor Department, which showed just under 3 million new jobless claims last week, pushing the seven-week tally well over 36 million.
A White House spokeswoman said Trump is open to another possible stimulus bill, but will not sign the bill put forward by House of Representatives Democrats.
“One of the major parts of the House bill is support for state and local governments and that’s critical for state institutions that are really hurt by this pandemic,” Ghriskey added.

Retirement benefits are the biggest component of Social Security. But the program also is very important for disabled people of all ages, as well as surviving children and spouses of deceased beneficiaries. And perhaps most important, today’s young people will need Social Security every bit as much as today’s retirees and near-retirees - and probably more so if current economic trends persist.
Yet many young people have been conditioned to think they should not count on Social Security to be there when their time to retire rolls around. That is not surprising, considering the negative, often false propaganda uttered by politicians hostile to Social Security and the financial services industry, and misleading media coverage.
The danger here is that the current high level of worry over Social Security’s viability could become self-fulfilling if it erodes political support. That would be especially damaging for young people when they retire, argues Peter Arno, an economist at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, and a scholar of both Social Security and health policy.
Arno points to four trends that suggest millennials will need to rely to a much greater extent on Social Security than current retirees and those approaching retirement now. Millennials will be far less likely to receive retirement income from defined benefit pensions, and they have lower rates of home ownership than earlier generations. And, wage stagnation and crippling levels of student debt make it impossible for many to save for retirement.
“If you add up all these factors, you have a constellation of things that will make it very difficult for young people down the road,” he said. “That’s why Social Security is crucially important for both this generation and younger people. Joining forces between older folks in the boomer generation and the millennial generation offers a tremendous strategic opportunity to bolster the long-term stability of Social Security.”
Politicians routinely claim that Social Security is going bankrupt and that its shortfalls drive the national deficit - neither is true. I often hear so-called experts from the financial services industry advise people to count on receiving only part of their future benefits. Good luck with that - just try running the numbers with only half of your projected Social Security benefits, and you will watch your plan collapse right there on your computer screen.
Much of the media coverage of the annual report of the Social Security trustees also is atrocious. Just this past April, the report’s release set off the predictable wave of erroneous headlines and broadcast reports stating that Social Security is “running out of money,” describing its “depleted funds” and advising people on how to prepare for a future retirement without their expected benefits.
Riddle me this: in what way is a program with a cumulative surplus of $2.9 trillion running out of money? The trustee report shows Social Security is fully funded until 2035, and 93 percent funded for the next 25 years. Yes, there is a funding problem: absent other changes, the combined retirement and disability trust funds will be empty in 2035.
At that point, current revenue would be sufficient to pay about 80 percent of schedule benefits. The ensuing across-the-board benefit cut would be very damaging for retirees and workers, but it seems a highly unlikely outcome from a political standpoint, considering the strong public support Social Security enjoys.
The shortfall is due to two factors: the falling ratio of workers paying into the system compared with expected retirees, and rising income inequality, which has pushed an increasing share of wages outside the payroll tax base.
A straightforward, middle-of-the-road solution is available, and making its way through the House of Representatives now. The Social Security 2100 Act puts Social Security back into balance over the next 75 years by raising payroll tax rates so gradually that few would notice - one-tenth of 1 percent per year - and by adding new payroll taxes to wages over $400,000; currently, tax collection stops at $132,900 of annual income.

WORRY ABOUT THE FUTURE
Nonetheless, the public continues to worry about Social Security’s future.
According to Gallup survey data (bit.ly/2HTLuIn), 73 percent of Americans aged 55 or older worry about the Social Security system ""a great deal"" or ""a fair amount."" Among people age 35-54, the figure is 67 percent; among those 18-34, it is 59 percent.
Arno argues we now have a historic opportunity to unite boomers and millennials in support of strengthening Social Security. In a provocative article that he co-authored recently in the American Prospect (bit.ly/2WeWJC2), Arno takes on the root causes of the cynicism so many young people have today about Social Security and argues that Social Security should be a centerpiece policy issue for anyone interested in civil rights and social justice.
“Social Security is the most successful anti-poverty policy in the history of the United States,” Arno said. “And this is not true just for seniors, but across the entire life cycle and the entire population. It reduces more poverty for children than any other policy, more poverty for working adults and more poverty for seniors. So it’s an intergenerational antipoverty program.”
The program’s impact is especially profound for people of color and women, he adds, noting that wage disparities create economic disadvantage that persists in retirement. This is an intergenerational justice issue,” he said. “Intergenerational in the sense that it affects all generations, not just seniors, but everyone that’s working and families and kids. That’s why I want to get folks to not see Social Security exclusively as a senior’s issue.”
You can hear a longer conversation that I had recently with Arno about Social Security on my podcast. (bit.ly/2YH2Htc).

1409,"A previous boom that saw gun sales double over a decade through 2016 corresponded largely with Democratic President Barack Obama’s time in office, when fears that gun control laws would be enacted drove gun aficionados to stock up.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guns-sales/u-s-gun-sales-down-6-1-percent-in-2018-extending-trump-slump-idUSKCN1PN346?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews,reuters,gun-control,center,71,1,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"(Reuters) - U.S. firearms sales fell 6.1 percent in 2018, according to industry data reported on Tuesday, marking the second straight year of declines and extending the “Trump slump” following the November 2016 election of pro-gun rights President Donald Trump.

The National Shooting Sports Foundation estimated 2018 sales at 13.1 million firearms, down from 14 million the previous year and down 16.5 percent from record 2016 sales of 15.7 million.
A previous boom that saw gun sales double over a decade through 2016 corresponded largely with Democratic President Barack Obama’s time in office, when fears that gun control laws would be enacted drove gun aficionados to stock up.
Industry representatives attributed the subsequent decline to a market correction as well as politics.
“Obama was the best-selling president for guns. Every time he opened his mouth,” said Trisha Kinney, owner of Blue Collar Firearms in Colton, California.
The peak year of 2016 coincided with the presidential campaign in which Democrat Hillary Clinton was expected to win. Steady monthly increases only reversed themselves in December, after the victory of Republican Trump.
Consumer gun sales affect a $40 billion industry of manufacturers and retailers of guns, ammunition and accessories.
“The industry was in dire need of a correction. We lived through a 20-year bubble. That’s one of the biggest reasons we’re seeing a little bit longer-lasting correction,” said Dave Howell, founder of Howell Munitions & Technology, whose Idaho-based company filed for bankruptcy protection last year.
Howell dated the boom to the presidency of Democrat Bill Clinton in the 1990s and said it extended throughout the Republican administration of George W. Bush, bucking the normal political trend in reaction to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
In California, the state with some of the strictest gun laws, some retailers reported brisk sales in part because Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom promised additional measures during his campaign. Kinney said her new-gun sales rose 14 percent in 2018.
Kurt Krasne, president of San Diego-based holster and magazine maker Triple K Manufacturing Co, said he felt the pinch in 2017 but saw a recovery in the fourth quarter of 2018.
“I think 2019 will probably trend out to a little bit more normal instead of that crazy growth we experienced,” Krasne said.

1413,The El Paso attack has also put new pressure on a man some white nationalists praise as helping advance their movement: Donald Trump.,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-white-nationalism-insight/el-paso-massacre-upends-white-nationalists-normalization-strategy-idUSKCN1UY2B5,reuters,white-nationalism,center,71,1,Biased,No agreement,"RUSSELLVILLE, ARK. (Reuters) - Two years ago, America’s white nationalist movement stunned the country. Neo-Nazi demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, had turned deadly when a far-right protester drove a car through a crowd, killing one and injuring dozens. Some movement leaders regrouped. Instead of stoking outrage, they set out to build support with another tack: Looking normal.

The larger goal was what many white nationalists call “Phase 2” — gaining mainstream acceptance for far-right ideas widely rejected as repugnant and getting white nationalists into positions of influence. The normalization effort included softened rhetoric and social gatherings that, for many groups, would increasingly replace confrontational rallies.
“The strategy is internally focused now — having families get together,” said alt-right blogger Brad Griffin, a self-avowed white nationalist from Montgomery, Alabama. He fondly recalled a river-tubing trip he organized in 2018 for friends who had attended a local white nationalist conference. The goal of such low-key gatherings, he said, is to spread far-right ideology away from the public spectacle of a public protest. “It’s a lot more fun to do that than to go out and tangle with Antifa” — members of America’s far-left “anti-fascist” movement — “and get hit with piss balloons in the street.”
(INTERACTIVE: tmsnrt.rs/2MXA7kL)
Griffin spoke in an interview before last weekend’s massacre in El Paso, Texas — an event that has scrambled the calculus for the movement’s aspiring normalizers.
On Saturday, authorities say, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius shot and killed 22 people and wounded two dozen more shortly after a manifesto appeared online explaining his motivation and decrying a “Hispanic invasion” of the United States.
The El Paso attack has also put new pressure on a man some white nationalists praise as helping advance their movement: Donald Trump. The U.S. president has come under sustained criticism for his racially incendiary rhetoric since launching his candidacy in 2015 — including his repeated use of the word “invasion” to describe immigration along the U.S.-Mexico border.
On Monday, Trump issued his most forceful disavowal of white supremacism to date. “In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy,” Trump said in response to the weekend’s shootings. “These sinister ideologies must be defeated.”
After Charlottesville, the lie-low approach was seen as a necessity by some in the movement. Many white nationalist groups were sued and lost access to social media, which has caused them to avoid public confrontations, said Heidi Beirich, who studies far-right groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit civil rights organization that tracks extremists.
“We haven’t seen many rallies since Charlottesville,” she said. The combination of bad press, prosecutions and lost access to social media, has “depressed people in the movement” and created a sense that “maybe the softer approach is the way to go.”
The shootings, and Trump’s repudiation, leave the normalizers in a difficult, perhaps impossible spot. Their gambit was always a stretch.
A Reuters photojournalist has observed the approach up close — at a children’s nursery in a “church” run by the Ku Klux Klan (KKK); a restaurant-and-bar that caters to white supremacists in Georgia; a barbecue held in Arkansas by the ShieldWall Network, a self-avowed neo-Nazi group with dozens of members. Even as they described their hopes of mainstreaming, many members of these and other groups also voiced the violent tropes that animate the movement.
(WIDER IMAGE photo essay: reut.rs/2KnI80l )
One is the so-called Great Replacement conspiracy theory, common in white nationalist circles, which holds that leftist elites are engineering the replacement of white majorities globally through policies that encourage mass migrations as white birth rates decline. The manifesto tied to the El Paso shooting referenced the replacement theory in explaining why the shooter chose to kill Hispanic people.
Asked in a May interview how whites could regain demographic dominance, ShieldWall’s leader, Billy Roper, told Reuters that promoting a higher birth rate among white people is helpful, but “bullets” would be faster. Roper said his organization doesn’t advocate anything illegal but that he “couldn’t disagree” with the goals of the mass shooter who murdered 51 people at two Muslim mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March. That killer, too, had cited the replacement theory as a motive.
In a phone interview after the Texas massacre, Roper said he didn’t support the killings. But the victims, Roper said, “were just pawns in the Jewish game of demographic replacement of whites,” adding that such “cultural conflicts” are an “unfortunate fact of modern life” in an increasingly diverse nation moving closer to racial “balkanization.”
The strategy of trying to couch such extreme views in mainstream rhetoric is not new. One of the highest-profile examples of the normalization tack is that of David Duke, a former KKK grand wizard who traded the klan’s signature white robes and pointy hats for a business suit, adopted more mainstream conservative talking points, and made the runoff election for Louisiana governor in 1991. Duke lost by a wide margin but drew support from about half the state’s white voters.
The normalization effort is also not universal. Some far-right groups are still known for confrontation, including the Proud Boys, who last October fought with people protesting a Republican Club event in New York City.
Members of the National Socialist Movement, a neo-Nazi group, carry guns and other weapons (left) as they gather in a parking lot before attending a rally at the state capitol in Little Rock, Arkansas, in November 2018. The group was protesting what it called the “white genocide” taking place in South Africa.
In Draketown, Georgia, Pat Lanzo runs a restaurant-and-bar that white supremacists have claimed as their own. Lanzo insists the Georgia Peach Oyster Bar is merely a celebration of free speech.
“We’re not racist,” he said. “We hate everyone equally.”
The decor inside his bar is filled with the kind of racist tropes that remain a hard sell with mainstream America. His menus feature a drawing of a Klan member relaxing on a hammock made of two lynched black corpses tied together at the feet. And Lanzo has rented his property to neo-Nazis and klan members for cross burnings, a traditional show of force by the KKK in the American South.
The image-scrubbing by today’s white nationalists belies a long history of violence by far-right ideologues. In the ten years ending in 2018, murderers motivated by far-right ideology took the lives of 124 people in 62 incidents, according to the U.S. Extremist Crime Database, a collaboration of criminal justice researchers from multiple universities. The statistics include white supremacists but also those with other far-right agendas that are not focused on race, such as anti-government militants.
Thomas Robb, the national director of The Knights Party, a group formerly named the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, said the movement should think beyond confrontations and rallies.
“When the rally’s over, what do you do?” said Robb in an interview before the El Paso shootings. “Our goal isn’t so much to get membership, but influence. When people come to our website, they see responsible people who aren’t using the ‘N word’ in every sentence.” Instead, Robb said, the aim is to “speak like Corporate America” as a way to make far-right ideas more palatable to a broader audience.
White nationalists have always debated whether putting “reasonable clothing” on their movement would get them further than street clashes and violence, said Mike German, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning policy institute. But the approach appears to have gained momentum under Trump in part because of the president’s racially divisive rhetoric, said German, who previously spent years undercover with white nationalists as an agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
“Before, white nationalists were trying to shove their way into the mainstream,” German said. “Now, they’re being invited in.”
It’s far from clear whether many true believers are ready for life in the mainstream.
This past April in Russellville, Arkansas, a lakeside college town, three members of the ShieldWall Network gathered to rent a houseboat and cruise around Lake Dardanelle. A Reuters photojournalist went with them.
Moods were light; they toasted one another with Fireball whiskey shots, laughed when one of them dropped his phone in the lake and cooed as another cuddled with his pregnant wife. Later that night, the group would initiate a new recruit, Nicholas Holloway, and burn wooden swastikas.
Two months later, in June, Holloway and two other ShieldWall members on the boat that day — Julian Calfy and John Carollo — were arrested for allegedly beating a gay man and holding a gun to his head after luring him to Calfy’s home with a false dating advertisement, according to police reports. Calfy remains in jail, while the other two members are free on bail, according to a spokesman for the Pope County, Arkansas, Sheriff’s Office. Each is charged with third-degree battery, first-degree terroristic threatening and first-degree criminal mischief in connection with the attack.
Neither the defendants nor their attorneys could be reached for comment.

Griffin, the alt-right blogger, condemned the El Paso shooting in stronger terms than other extremists who spoke to Reuters, calling it and other mass shootings by avowed white nationalists “insane tragedies.”
At the same time, Griffin said he supported resegregation of the races, echoing one of the core principles of the manifesto that authorities tied to the Texas shooter.
The continuing violence, he said, undermines any attempt by the movement to gain more mainstream acceptance. At this point, he said, most white nationalists would rather just “stay out of the debate.”","['white', 'nationalists']"
1420,"Welcome to the longest U.S. economic expansion in history, one perhaps best characterized by the excesses of extreme wealth and an ever-widening chasm between the unfathomably rich and everyone else.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-inequality-poll/majority-of-americans-favor-wealth-tax-on-very-rich-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKBN1Z9141,reuters,middle-class,center,72,1,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The idea of imposing a wealth tax on the richest Americans has elicited sharply divergent views across a spectrum of politicians, with President Donald Trump branding it socialist and progressive Democratic presidential contenders Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders prominently endorsing it.
But it may have broad public support, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll that found nearly two-thirds of respondents agree that the very rich should pay more.
Among the 4,441 respondents to the poll, 64% strongly or somewhat agreed that “the very rich should contribute an extra share of their total wealth each year to support public programs” - the essence of a wealth tax. Results were similar across gender, race and household income. While support among Democrats was stronger, at 77%, a majority of Republicans, 53%, also agreed with the idea.
A wealth tax is levied on an individual’s net worth, such as stocks, bonds and real estate, as well as cash holdings, similar in concept to property taxes. It is separate from an income tax, which applies to wages, interest and dividends, among other sources.
Asked in the poll if “the very rich should be allowed to keep the money they have, even if that means increasing inequality,” 54% of respondents disagreed.
“Rich people have a right to blow their money on Lamborghinis and world-wide cruises or whatever,” said Esin Zimmerman, 53, a lifelong Republican from Madison, Minnesota, who wants higher taxes for the wealthy. “But that money could be used in other ways that help people.”
Zimmerman said she would especially be in favor of a wealth tax that would help pay for government programs for U.S. military veterans, or help single parents with young children. “It could put the border wall up,” she said.
The results may reflect how the economic changes of the past roughly 20 years, from globalization to the financial crisis, have shaped attitudes about economic policy.
According to polling by Gallup, concerns about the rich paying too little actually declined through the 1990s and early 2000s, a relative boom period for the United States. But the concerns have been climbing since the crisis years of 2007 to 2009, from 55% to more than 60% as of 2016 here
The Reuters/Ipsos results suggested even stronger support for an annual levy on total wealth, not just income. Warren and Sanders have touted the idea as a way to help pay for major social programs like Medicare for All and to reverse a stark rise in the share of wealth owned by the very richest Americans, known as the “1 percent.”
The poll also points to changing attitudes toward basic ideas such as “keeping what you earn.”
That notion, central to a winner-take-all brand of capitalism, got mixed reviews. While 56% of Republicans agreed the very rich should keep what they have regardless of the impact on inequality, 35% of Republicans disagreed with the statement, as did 71% of Democrats.
Republican survey respondents interviewed by Reuters said they did not see their support for a wealth tax conflicting with their party ideals or their support for Trump.
Kathy Herron, 56, a Republican who lives in Santa Rosa, California, said her support for Trump - a self-proclaimed billionaire - stems from his hardline policies on illegal immigration. In her view, the president would do well to support higher taxes on rich Americans. “We’re taxed from one end to the other, and it just seems the rich don’t pay their share,” she said.
In recent years in particular, mainstream economic institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the Federal Reserve have taken seriously the possibility that high levels of wealth and income inequality may be not just politically corrosive, but bad for economic growth.
At the most recent Fed policy meeting, staff members presented research on how families’ differing access to credit might make a recession worse — the sort of exercise that shows how unequal starting points among households can influence national outcomes.
FILE PHOTO: The Charging Bull or Wall Street Bull is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., January 16, 2019. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo
Economic and market trends have likely reinforced doubts about who gets ahead, and how fast. Since the start in 2009 of a now-decade-long recovery, the top 1 percent’s share of national net worth has grown from 27.8% to 32.2%, driven by a record-setting boom in the stock market, according to Fed data.
Trump has cited the rise in equity markets as a selling point in his campaign, which is centered on taking credit for historically low unemployment, and a tariff-heavy trade policy that he says will restore manufacturing jobs.
But that has not changed the country’s wealth picture. While the share of wealth held by the bottom 50% of Americans has increased since the crisis, to 1.5% percent, longterm the trend is down, with their share at less than half what it was in 1989. The shares of wealth held by the middle and upper middle classes - or all other Americans save for the richest 1 percent — have all fallen since the crisis.","['unfathomably', 'extreme', 'chasm']"

In Spain, hundreds of thousands of women, wearing purple and raising their fists, took to the streets of cities around the country calling for greater gender equality.
The issue has become deeply divisive in Spain ahead of a national election on April 28. A new far-right party, Vox, has called for a 2004 law on domestic violence against women to be scrapped, and stands to win dozens of seats, opinion polls show.
In Berlin, city authorities declared Women’s Day a formal holiday and thousands joined a colorful demonstration under sunny skies at the German capital’s Alexanderplatz.
In Paris, demonstrators from Amnesty International waved placards outside the Saudi Arabian embassy that read “Honk for women’s rights”, and called for the release of jailed women activists, including some campaigners for the right to drive in the deeply conservative kingdom.
In Athens and Kiev, women protesters demanded equality and an end to violence against women.
In Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city, hundreds called for the release of Syrian women in jail. But in the evening, Turkish police fired tear gas to break up a crowd gathered for a march, Reuters witnesses said.
Hundreds of riot police blocked the marchers’ path to prevent them advancing along the district’s main pedestrian avenue. Police then fired pepper spray and pellets containing tear gas to disperse the crowd, and scuffles broke out as they pursued the women into side streets off the avenue.
It was not clear if anyone was hurt or if people were detained.
Turkish police regularly block the staging of protests in central Istanbul and elsewhere. Ankara tightened restrictions after the imposition of emergency rule following an attempted coup in 2016. The state of emergency was lifted last July.
EQUALITY AND RESPECT
In Russia, where Women’s Day has been an important festival since Communist times, flowers and congratulatory messages decorated public spaces.
In Spain, one of the country’s largest unions, UGT, said an estimated 6 million people went on strike across the country for at least two hours to demand equal pay and rights for women.
Spain’s government said it would not provide estimates on the rate of participation.

In Berlin’s Alexanderplatz, protester Anna Lob told Reuters she had been sexually assaulted during an internship.
“A male colleague grabbed my ass while I was standing in a circle with some men,” she said. “Physical assaults in any form or (sexist) comments, jokes or something you have to listen to over and over again - that is a form of discrimination.”
Also in Alexanderplatz, Paula Schramm said she had seen some moves toward greater equality but many women remained disadvantaged in their daily lives. “And that is why I am here. I want to change this so that it becomes equal at some point.”
In Paris, Cameroonian rights activist Aissa Doumara was honored for her campaign against forced marriages by President Emmanuel Macron. At a ceremony at the Elysee Palace, he handed Doumara the first women’s rights prize dedicated to the late French minister and abortion campaigner Simone Veil.
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa joined a women’s rights protest in downtown Lisbon. “When there is a difference of 18 percent on average between the salary of men and women, disparity in political positions, and when there is barbarity such as gender violence, it’s a sign that there is still much to do in the fight for women’s rights,” he told the crowd.
Twelve women have died so far this year in domestic violence in Portugal.

1442,Gun control activists on Monday criticized guidance issued by President Donald Trump’s administration recommending that states find that gun stores are critical businesses that can stay open during the coronavirus crisis.,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-guns/trump-coronavirus-guidance-on-keeping-gun-stores-open-draws-criticism-idUSKBN21H37L?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews,reuters,gun-control,center,73,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Gun control activists on Monday criticized guidance issued by President Donald Trump’s administration recommending that states find that gun stores are critical businesses that can stay open during the coronavirus crisis.

The new guidance, issued on Saturday by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, offers the administration’s views on which workers are essential during the pandemic at a time when state governors have ordered numerous “non-essential” businesses to close to try to limit the spread of the virus. The agency is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Gun control advocates said gun rights groups are sowing fear during the pandemic in order to boost firearms sales, adding that increased gun ownership during the crisis could lead to more domestic violence.
“Adding more guns to more homes during a time of more anxiety could lead to more deaths. And that’s the last thing we need when our hospitals are already bursting at the seams,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a leading gun control group.
Kris Brown, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said gun industry groups have “exploited the current crisis to further the interests of gun manufacturers.”
The agency’s guidance stated that “workers supporting the operation of firearm or ammunition product manufacturers, retailers, importers, distributors and shooting ranges” are among those the administration considers vital during the crisis. Other essential businesses listed included healthcare facilities, grocery stores, transportation companies and the energy sector.
The guidance carries no formal legal weight. Governors, who decide the content of emergency orders like those already in place in numerous states, do not have to follow it though they could cite it as justification for their decisions.
The list is intended to help states “protect their communities, while ensuring continuity of functions critical to public health and safety,” Christopher Krebs, the agency’s director, wrote in a memorandum issued with the new guidance.
The administration’s intervention has been welcomed by gun rights groups, which have been lobbying to keep gun stores open and in some case filing lawsuits in several states including California and New Jersey.
“In these uncertain times, the ability to protect yourself - and to acquire firearms, magazines and ammunition - should not be ignored,” said Erich Pratt, senior vice president of Gun Owners of America.

But it may have broad public support, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll that found nearly two-thirds of respondents agree that the very rich should pay more.
Among the 4,441 respondents to the poll, 64% strongly or somewhat agreed that “the very rich should contribute an extra share of their total wealth each year to support public programs” - the essence of a wealth tax. Results were similar across gender, race and household income. While support among Democrats was stronger, at 77%, a majority of Republicans, 53%, also agreed with the idea.
A wealth tax is levied on an individual’s net worth, such as stocks, bonds and real estate, as well as cash holdings, similar in concept to property taxes. It is separate from an income tax, which applies to wages, interest and dividends, among other sources.
Asked in the poll if “the very rich should be allowed to keep the money they have, even if that means increasing inequality,” 54% of respondents disagreed.
“Rich people have a right to blow their money on Lamborghinis and world-wide cruises or whatever,” said Esin Zimmerman, 53, a lifelong Republican from Madison, Minnesota, who wants higher taxes for the wealthy. “But that money could be used in other ways that help people.”
Zimmerman said she would especially be in favor of a wealth tax that would help pay for government programs for U.S. military veterans, or help single parents with young children. “It could put the border wall up,” she said.
The results may reflect how the economic changes of the past roughly 20 years, from globalization to the financial crisis, have shaped attitudes about economic policy.
According to polling by Gallup, concerns about the rich paying too little actually declined through the 1990s and early 2000s, a relative boom period for the United States. But the concerns have been climbing since the crisis years of 2007 to 2009, from 55% to more than 60% as of 2016 here
The Reuters/Ipsos results suggested even stronger support for an annual levy on total wealth, not just income. Warren and Sanders have touted the idea as a way to help pay for major social programs like Medicare for All and to reverse a stark rise in the share of wealth owned by the very richest Americans, known as the “1 percent.”
The poll also points to changing attitudes toward basic ideas such as “keeping what you earn.”
That notion, central to a winner-take-all brand of capitalism, got mixed reviews. While 56% of Republicans agreed the very rich should keep what they have regardless of the impact on inequality, 35% of Republicans disagreed with the statement, as did 71% of Democrats.
Republican survey respondents interviewed by Reuters said they did not see their support for a wealth tax conflicting with their party ideals or their support for Trump.
Kathy Herron, 56, a Republican who lives in Santa Rosa, California, said her support for Trump - a self-proclaimed billionaire - stems from his hardline policies on illegal immigration. In her view, the president would do well to support higher taxes on rich Americans. “We’re taxed from one end to the other, and it just seems the rich don’t pay their share,” she said.
In recent years in particular, mainstream economic institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the Federal Reserve have taken seriously the possibility that high levels of wealth and income inequality may be not just politically corrosive, but bad for economic growth.
At the most recent Fed policy meeting, staff members presented research on how families’ differing access to credit might make a recession worse — the sort of exercise that shows how unequal starting points among households can influence national outcomes.

Economic and market trends have likely reinforced doubts about who gets ahead, and how fast. Since the start in 2009 of a now-decade-long recovery, the top 1 percent’s share of national net worth has grown from 27.8% to 32.2%, driven by a record-setting boom in the stock market, according to Fed data.
Trump has cited the rise in equity markets as a selling point in his campaign, which is centered on taking credit for historically low unemployment, and a tariff-heavy trade policy that he says will restore manufacturing jobs.
But that has not changed the country’s wealth picture. While the share of wealth held by the bottom 50% of Americans has increased since the crisis, to 1.5% percent, longterm the trend is down, with their share at less than half what it was in 1989. The shares of wealth held by the middle and upper middle classes - or all other Americans save for the richest 1 percent — have all fallen since the crisis.",[]

A lone gunman, armed with two powerful semi-automatic rifles and other weapons, had entered two mosques, shooting dead 50 people and wounding 50 more.
Six days later, Prime Minister Ardern announced New Zealand’s gun laws - little altered for almost three decades and much less restrictive than neighboring Australia - would be overhauled to ban the type of semi-automatic weapons used in the attack.
Ardern was applauded by many, but there was uncertainty about how the rural community that make up most of the country’s quarter of a million gun owners, would react.
“I’m fine with it,” said Salvesen, who owns three guns but not of the type that will be banned. “I don’t have a need for them and very few do.”
Salvesen said he admired Ardern’s response since the tragedy. “She’s come across confident when needed, sympathetic when needed and she’s said pretty much what most people were thinking.”
Most farmers in New Zealand own guns, which they use for killing pests such as possums and rabbits, and for putting down injured stock.
Recreational hunting of deer, pigs, and goats is popular for sport and food, while gun clubs and shooting ranges dot the country.
The new laws allow for some exemptions for pest control.
Shaun Moloney, who culls pests including goats and wallabies across the South Island, said there was “definitely a place” for semi-automatic weapons with larger magazines for jobs like his.
“If you are having a very tightly controlled access to that style ... but it’s still available, that is welcomed by several of my associates and myself,” he said.
Hunting - with the kinds of weapons excluded from the ban - was an important part of life for his family, Moloney said.
“My daughter would go out and shoot rabbits, with a semi-auto, with me, and then we’d skin and gut it, she’d cook and eat it and then go to ballet,” he said.
WIDE SUPPORT
New Zealand’s main farm lobby group quickly came out in support of the new laws.
“This will not be popular among some of our members but...we believe this is the only practicable solution,” Federated Farmers Rural Security spokesman Miles Anderson said in a statement. “Christchurch, Friday March 15 has changed everything.”
The main opposition National Party, which draws strong support in rural New Zealand, also backed the plans.
Under the changes, all military style semi-automatics (MSSA) and assault rifles will be banned, along with parts used to convert weapons into MSSAs and all high-capacity magazines.
The changes exclude two general classes of firearms which are commonly used for hunting, pest control, stock management on farms, and duck shooting: small bore rifles with magazines of no more than 10 rounds, and pump action shotguns holding no more than five rounds.
Bruce Plant, a rifle range club secretary in Oamaru, south of Christchurch, said there was little need for military-style weapons in New Zealand.
“If you are out hunting and can’t hit an animal with one shot you are certainly not going to hit it with 20 shots.”
Experts say the changes don’t go as far as Australia which toughened gun laws 12 days after the shooting of 35 people at Port Arthur in Tasmania in 1996. There all semi-automatic rifles and semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns are banned. There is also a restrictive system of licensing and ownership controls.
HIGH GUN OWNERSHIP
New Zealand has a lot of guns. With a population of just under 5 million, there are an estimated 1.5 million firearms.
In 2017, it had the 17th highest rate of civilian firearm ownership in the world, with 26.3 guns per 100 residents, according to the Small Arms Survey. The United States tops the list with 120.5 guns per 100 residents.
The last real change to New Zealand’s Arms Act was made in 1992, following a shooting where 13 people were killed by a gunman with a semi-automatic weapon in Aramoana, a small South Island coastal settlement.
A special E-category license, which requires tough checks, was added to cover MSSAs.
Advocates say New Zealand’s high gun ownership rates and low rates of gun violence are evidence of a system that works. Restrictions are certainly tighter than in the United States.
However, individual weapons are not registered, meaning police have little oversight over how many guns people hold.
Ardern said a further tranche of reforms will cover the firearm registry and licensing.
John Hart, a farm owner and former Green Party candidate, surrendered his semi-automatic rifle to police after the shooting, one of 37 weapons police said had been voluntarily returned ahead of the new laws.
“The time is right. I have spoken to many farmers who feel the same way. They have not given theirs (guns) back but they support the idea - although they won’t do it until they have to.”
Noel Womersley, who slaughters cattle for small farmers around Christchurch, said he was happy to sell his AR-15 rifle into a government buyback expected to cost up to NZ$200 million ($138 million)
“I’m using guns every day. I use them on the weekends, in my spare time, and I use them at work every day. But I don’t need a semi-automatic military firearm.”

Feb 4 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq hit a record high on Tuesday and the S&P 500 headed for its best day in six months as fears of a heavy economic impact from the coronavirus epidemic tapered off after China’s central bank intervened for the second straight day.
The Dow Industrials was on pace for its biggest daily percentage gain in eight months. The benchmark S&P 500 had more than made up for last week’s 2% loss, which was its steepest weekly drop in six months.
China injected 1.7 trillion yuan ($242.74 billion) via reverse repos on Monday and Tuesday, helping Chinese stocks recover some losses and lifting the world equity index .
The stimulus boosted investor sentiment even as several economists cut forecasts for 2020 global growth as the fast-spreading virus hampers business operations in the world’s second-largest economy.
“If China is doing what it needs to contain the worst-case scenario from a financial perspective, then maybe the weakness we saw last week was a little overdone,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird.
Technology stocks, which are typically sensitive to growth-related concerns in China, led the charge with their 2.6% gain. The China-focused Philadelphia SE semiconductor index climbed 3.1%.
Alphabet Inc dropped 2.8% after Google’s advertising business and new data about YouTube and Google Cloud broadly disappointed.

Adding to the optimism was data that showed new orders for U.S.-made goods rose by the most in nearly one and a half years in December. It comes a day after a surprise rebound in factory activity in January.

1494,"The biggest swimming pool in Russia’s Muslim-majority North Caucasus region has banned women, prompting anger from rights activists and others who have accused the sports complex of discrimination.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-religion-women/biggest-swimming-pool-in-russias-muslim-south-bans-women-causing-outcry-idUSKBN1ZL1HW,reuters,gender,center,75,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The biggest swimming pool in Russia’s Muslim-majority North Caucasus region has banned women, prompting anger from rights activists and others who have accused the sports complex of discrimination.
The Anzhi Arena spa-complex near Makhachkala, the capital of the internal Russian republic of Dagestan, announced its policy change on the Instagram social media platform on Monday.
“From Jan. 20 onwards attendance of the pool is open only to men,” it said.
The decision has sparked heated debate among residents of the mountainous region, where traditional social values and conservative interpretations of Islam often put it at odds with large parts of European Russia where more liberal values prevail.
The swimming pool said its decision to deny entry to women, who were previously only admitted on Fridays for women-only sessions, was financially motivated.
“Unfortunately, there were hardly any visitors during women’s days,” the RIA news agency cited the spa complex as saying on its Instagram page, which has now been set to private.
“Specifically because of this, after a thorough analysis and evaluation, the difficult decision was made that keeping days for women open in our pool was not viable.”
It is common in the North Caucasus region to find sports facilities offering men and women access on separate days of the week. But a complete ban on women using the pool goes against the Russian constitution, activists said.

Fatima Abdulkhalimova, 31, said she could no longer use the pool despite working there as an instructor.
“I do demonstrations, show people the correct technique, and now I’m not allowed to enter the water,” Abdulkhalimova, a former professional swimmer, said.
“I think it’s to do with religion, I believe it is because a lot of religious guys come here,” she said.
Access to the pool had initially been permitted for both men and women, she said, before being restricted to Fridays only for women.
If having women-only days was not financially viable, then why not simply return to the earlier, mixed-gender system, Abdulkhalimova questioned.
Three women from Dagestan have now filed a complaint to the regional Prosecutor’s Office accusing the sports complex of unconstitutional gender-based discrimination, a copy of the document, shared by Olga Gnezdilova, a lawyer with the Rights Initiative Project, showed.
One of the complainants is Svetlana Anokhina, editor of a local online media platform focused on women’s rights. She said the practice of separating public spaces by gender was on the rise.
“I have a daughter here and she has three daughters too. I’m angry because... I’m afraid for them. I don’t want them to live in a special ghetto for women,” Anokhina, who is based in Makhachkala, said.

Until the last few years, all Washington could talk about was how to cut Social Security benefits, and by how much. But a grass-roots progressive coalition began campaigning for expansion in 2013, and the idea has since moved straight to the heart of the Democratic Party.
That was evident this week when U.S. Representative John Larson introduced his Social Security 2100 Act in the House of Representatives. The Connecticut Democrat’s proposal calls for a small across-the-board bump in benefits, a more generous annual cost-of-living adjustment and a higher minimum benefit for low-income workers. Larson’s plan would pay for the expansion in two ways. First, it would add new payroll taxes to wages over $400,000 (currently, tax collection stops at $132,900 of annual income). The bill also would gradually phase in a higher payroll tax rate, with workers and employers each paying 7.4 percent by 2042, compared with the current rate of 6.2 percent.
This is not the first time Larson has proposed this legislation, but this year it stands a very good chance of passage in the House. The proposal had 54 co-sponsors when Larson first introduced it in 2015; now, it has more than 200 House co-sponsors - more than 85 percent of the Democratic majority.
Larson himself is the new chairman of the Social Security subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. The new chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, Massachusetts Democrat Richard Neal, is a co-sponsor of the bill.
Moreover, progressive support for Social Security expansion was an important campaign plank for many successful Democratic candidates in November’s midterm elections. And nearly every declared and potential Democratic presidential candidate has endorsed expansion of some type for Social Security.
The bill is not likely to become law while Republicans control the Senate and White House. But Larson plans to hold hearings on the bill this year in Washington and around the country - the first congressional hearings focused on expansion in 50 years.
That will provide an important forum to help educate the public and could puncture many of the toxic myths that have taken hold about Social Security in recent decades. Among the most pernicious of those myths is that Social Security is headed for bankruptcy, and that benefits will not be there for young people when their retirement rolls around.
“We need to educate and unmask so many of these myths,” Larson told me in an interview. “We need to talk about why Social Security is an earned benefit and not an entitlement. Certainly it is something you are entitled to, but the word makes Social Security sound like a poverty program or a handout. Nothing roils people who have been paying into the program their entire lives more.”
FIXING THE SHORTFALL
The myths are built on one very important kernel of truth. Social Security does face a shortfall in revenue needed to pay scheduled benefits. If Congress fails to act, Social Security benefits will be cut nearly 25 percent in 2034 - just 15 years from now. This would be a financial disaster for current and future retirees, and it would undermine trust in the program.
Larson’s bill puts Social Security back into balance over the next 75 years - the period of time the program is required by federal law to project its finances. On the benefit side, it provides an increase for all enrollees equivalent to 2 percent of the average benefit, about $30 per month. It would shift to a more generous annual cost-of-living adjustment formula that is more sensitive to medical inflation and other costs disproportionately affecting seniors. The bill would also beef up the special minimum benefit paid to low-income retirees.
For higher-income seniors, the bill also includes, effectively, a benefit boost in the form of a tax cut.
Beneficiaries with higher income - usually from work, a pension or drawdowns from tax-deferred saving - often wind up paying income taxes on their Social Security benefits.
The proportion of benefit that is taxable is determined using a formula called “provisional income” - your adjusted gross income (excluding Social Security benefits), plus non-taxable interest and half of your Social Security benefits. If your provisional income is $25,000 to $34,000 (single return) or $32,000 to $44,000 (joint return), up to 50 percent of your Social Security benefit must be counted as adjusted gross income. If your provisional income is more than $34,000 on a single return or $44,000 on a joint return, 85 percent must be added to AGI.
The Larson bill would replace those thresholds with $50,000 (single filer) and $100,000 (joint filers), and if provisional income is above those levels, up to 85 percent is counted in adjusted gross income.
Despite the bill’s strong odds in the House, the Republican-controlled Senate is not likely to take it up this year - although Larson says he is reaching out. He also has put feelers out to the White House, noting that President Donald Trump opposed cuts to Social Security during the 2016 campaign.
“I think we’re coming to some common-sense solutions,” Larson said. “Especially when one of the biggest champions of protecting Social Security is the President of the United States.”

The larger goal was what many white nationalists call “Phase 2” — gaining mainstream acceptance for far-right ideas widely rejected as repugnant and getting white nationalists into positions of influence. The normalization effort included softened rhetoric and social gatherings that, for many groups, would increasingly replace confrontational rallies.
“The strategy is internally focused now — having families get together,” said alt-right blogger Brad Griffin, a self-avowed white nationalist from Montgomery, Alabama. He fondly recalled a river-tubing trip he organized in 2018 for friends who had attended a local white nationalist conference. The goal of such low-key gatherings, he said, is to spread far-right ideology away from the public spectacle of a public protest. “It’s a lot more fun to do that than to go out and tangle with Antifa” — members of America’s far-left “anti-fascist” movement — “and get hit with piss balloons in the street.”

Griffin spoke in an interview before last weekend’s massacre in El Paso, Texas — an event that has scrambled the calculus for the movement’s aspiring normalizers.
On Saturday, authorities say, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius shot and killed 22 people and wounded two dozen more shortly after a manifesto appeared online explaining his motivation and decrying a “Hispanic invasion” of the United States.
The El Paso attack has also put new pressure on a man some white nationalists praise as helping advance their movement: Donald Trump. The U.S. president has come under sustained criticism for his racially incendiary rhetoric since launching his candidacy in 2015 — including his repeated use of the word “invasion” to describe immigration along the U.S.-Mexico border.
On Monday, Trump issued his most forceful disavowal of white supremacism to date. “In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy,” Trump said in response to the weekend’s shootings. “These sinister ideologies must be defeated.”
After Charlottesville, the lie-low approach was seen as a necessity by some in the movement. Many white nationalist groups were sued and lost access to social media, which has caused them to avoid public confrontations, said Heidi Beirich, who studies far-right groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit civil rights organization that tracks extremists.
“We haven’t seen many rallies since Charlottesville,” she said. The combination of bad press, prosecutions and lost access to social media, has “depressed people in the movement” and created a sense that “maybe the softer approach is the way to go.”
The shootings, and Trump’s repudiation, leave the normalizers in a difficult, perhaps impossible spot. Their gambit was always a stretch.
A Reuters photojournalist has observed the approach up close — at a children’s nursery in a “church” run by the Ku Klux Klan (KKK); a restaurant-and-bar that caters to white supremacists in Georgia; a barbecue held in Arkansas by the ShieldWall Network, a self-avowed neo-Nazi group with dozens of members. Even as they described their hopes of mainstreaming, many members of these and other groups also voiced the violent tropes that animate the movement.

One is the so-called Great Replacement conspiracy theory, common in white nationalist circles, which holds that leftist elites are engineering the replacement of white majorities globally through policies that encourage mass migrations as white birth rates decline. The manifesto tied to the El Paso shooting referenced the replacement theory in explaining why the shooter chose to kill Hispanic people.
Asked in a May interview how whites could regain demographic dominance, ShieldWall’s leader, Billy Roper, told Reuters that promoting a higher birth rate among white people is helpful, but “bullets” would be faster. Roper said his organization doesn’t advocate anything illegal but that he “couldn’t disagree” with the goals of the mass shooter who murdered 51 people at two Muslim mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March. That killer, too, had cited the replacement theory as a motive.
In a phone interview after the Texas massacre, Roper said he didn’t support the killings. But the victims, Roper said, “were just pawns in the Jewish game of demographic replacement of whites,” adding that such “cultural conflicts” are an “unfortunate fact of modern life” in an increasingly diverse nation moving closer to racial “balkanization.”
The strategy of trying to couch such extreme views in mainstream rhetoric is not new. One of the highest-profile examples of the normalization tack is that of David Duke, a former KKK grand wizard who traded the klan’s signature white robes and pointy hats for a business suit, adopted more mainstream conservative talking points, and made the runoff election for Louisiana governor in 1991. Duke lost by a wide margin but drew support from about half the state’s white voters.
The normalization effort is also not universal. Some far-right groups are still known for confrontation, including the Proud Boys, who last October fought with people protesting a Republican Club event in New York City.
Members of the National Socialist Movement, a neo-Nazi group, carry guns and other weapons (left) as they gather in a parking lot before attending a rally at the state capitol in Little Rock, Arkansas, in November 2018. The group was protesting what it called the “white genocide” taking place in South Africa.
In Draketown, Georgia, Pat Lanzo runs a restaurant-and-bar that white supremacists have claimed as their own. Lanzo insists the Georgia Peach Oyster Bar is merely a celebration of free speech.
“We’re not racist,” he said. “We hate everyone equally.”
The decor inside his bar is filled with the kind of racist tropes that remain a hard sell with mainstream America. His menus feature a drawing of a Klan member relaxing on a hammock made of two lynched black corpses tied together at the feet. And Lanzo has rented his property to neo-Nazis and klan members for cross burnings, a traditional show of force by the KKK in the American South.
The image-scrubbing by today’s white nationalists belies a long history of violence by far-right ideologues. In the ten years ending in 2018, murderers motivated by far-right ideology took the lives of 124 people in 62 incidents, according to the U.S. Extremist Crime Database, a collaboration of criminal justice researchers from multiple universities. The statistics include white supremacists but also those with other far-right agendas that are not focused on race, such as anti-government militants.
Thomas Robb, the national director of The Knights Party, a group formerly named the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, said the movement should think beyond confrontations and rallies.
“When the rally’s over, what do you do?” said Robb in an interview before the El Paso shootings. “Our goal isn’t so much to get membership, but influence. When people come to our website, they see responsible people who aren’t using the ‘N word’ in every sentence.” Instead, Robb said, the aim is to “speak like Corporate America” as a way to make far-right ideas more palatable to a broader audience.
White nationalists have always debated whether putting “reasonable clothing” on their movement would get them further than street clashes and violence, said Mike German, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning policy institute. But the approach appears to have gained momentum under Trump in part because of the president’s racially divisive rhetoric, said German, who previously spent years undercover with white nationalists as an agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
“Before, white nationalists were trying to shove their way into the mainstream,” German said. “Now, they’re being invited in.”
It’s far from clear whether many true believers are ready for life in the mainstream.
This past April in Russellville, Arkansas, a lakeside college town, three members of the ShieldWall Network gathered to rent a houseboat and cruise around Lake Dardanelle. A Reuters photojournalist went with them.
Moods were light; they toasted one another with Fireball whiskey shots, laughed when one of them dropped his phone in the lake and cooed as another cuddled with his pregnant wife. Later that night, the group would initiate a new recruit, Nicholas Holloway, and burn wooden swastikas.
Two months later, in June, Holloway and two other ShieldWall members on the boat that day — Julian Calfy and John Carollo — were arrested for allegedly beating a gay man and holding a gun to his head after luring him to Calfy’s home with a false dating advertisement, according to police reports. Calfy remains in jail, while the other two members are free on bail, according to a spokesman for the Pope County, Arkansas, Sheriff’s Office. Each is charged with third-degree battery, first-degree terroristic threatening and first-degree criminal mischief in connection with the attack.
Neither the defendants nor their attorneys could be reached for comment.

Griffin, the alt-right blogger, condemned the El Paso shooting in stronger terms than other extremists who spoke to Reuters, calling it and other mass shootings by avowed white nationalists “insane tragedies.”
At the same time, Griffin said he supported resegregation of the races, echoing one of the core principles of the manifesto that authorities tied to the Texas shooter.
The continuing violence, he said, undermines any attempt by the movement to gain more mainstream acceptance. At this point, he said, most white nationalists would rather just “stay out of the debate.”","['far-right', 'stunned', 'Neo-Nazi']"

Here is a look at gun control positions taken by Trump and the Democrats vying to unseat him.
DONALD TRUMP
In a speech shortly after two mass shootings last summer, Trump proposed tighter monitoring of the internet, mental health reform and wider use of the death penalty as a response to the shootings. He suggested he might support background checks for gun purchases.
But on Jan. 20, in advance of a Virginia rally by gun enthusiasts and militia members who oppose background checks for gun purchasers and other firearms restrictions that are being considered in the state, Trump criticized the reforms on Twitter.
“Your 2nd Amendment is under very serious attack in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia,” Trump wrote.
JOE BIDEN
Biden, who served as vice president under Democratic President Barack Obama from 2009-2017, supports renewing an expired assault weapons ban imposed in the 1990s. He has also called for a federal gun buyback program to reduce the number of weapons on the street.
Like other Democratic candidates, Biden supports universal background checks for gun sales. He would ban those convicted of hate crimes from owning or buying guns.
In addition to more background checks, Biden advocates so-called “smart guns” that require owners’ biometrics to pull the trigger.
BERNIE SANDERS
Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, supports universal background checks, a ban on the sale and distribution of assault weapons, a crackdown on straw purchases of guns for criminals, and the prohibition of high-capacity ammunition magazines.
He also supports so-called red flag laws, under which a court could take away guns from people deemed by a judge to be likely to hurt others with firearms, including stalkers and those accused of domestic abuse. He would ban the 3-D printing of firearms and bump stocks, which speed up the firing of semi-automatic weapons.
Sanders has called on the Republican-controlled Senate to vote on a bill requiring a background check on every gun sale and transfer, which passed the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives last year.
ELIZABETH WARREN
Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, has promised to send comprehensive gun violence prevention legislation to Congress within her first 100 days in office. She backs requiring universal background checks for gun purchasers, reporting mass purchases of firearms and raising the minimum age to own a gun to 18.
She says she would investigate the finances of the powerful gun rights lobbying organization, the National Rifle Association, and revoke licenses for gun dealers who make sales that do not comply with federal laws. She would expand rules meant to prevent gun violence by those suspected of domestic abuse.
Warren supports reinstating the federal assault weapons ban and creating a federal licensing system that requires gun owners to register their firearms.
PETE BUTTIGIEG
The former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Buttigieg supports universal background checks, banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and red flag laws that disarm domestic abusers and others ruled by a judge to be at high risk of harming others with a gun.
Buttigieg would require people to notify law enforcement if their guns are lost or stolen. Like several of his rivals, Buttigieg supports giving the FBI longer than the current three days to conduct a background check. He would close the “boyfriend loophole” by expanding a law restricting gun purchases by perpetrators of spousal abuse and would prohibit guns made without serial numbers or on 3D printers.
AMY KLOBUCHAR
Klobuchar, a U.S. senator from Minnesota, backs universal background checks, banning bump stocks that allow weapons to fire 700 rounds per minute and banning high-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.
She would fight for an assault weapons ban while more immediately raising the minimum age to buy such weapons from 18 to 21. She would prevent people with severe mental illness from acquiring guns and establish a waiting period for sales of handguns and assault rifles. She would prohibit the online publication of computer codes used for 3-D printing of firearms.
She authored legislation, stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate, to close the so-called “boyfriend loophole.”
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG
The billionaire former mayor of New York has long backed stricter firearms laws, co-founding or championing gun control groups, including Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Moms Demand Action and Everytown for Gun Safety. He spent $110 million backing gun safety candidates in the 2018 election cycle, his campaign website says.
Bloomberg backs universal background checks, reinstating the federal assault weapons ban and prohibiting the sale of high-capacity magazines. He would raise the age to legally purchase handguns and semi-automatic weapons to 21 and temporarily ban gun possession by people convicted of assault and other violent crimes.
He would ban all guns at schools, colleges and universities except for those used by law enforcement. He would also extend beyond spouses a law meant to protect victims of domestic abuse.
ANDREW YANG
Yang, a businessman, has backed comprehensive gun control measures including an assault weapon ban and prohibiting high-capacity magazines.
He supports creating a tax credit to incentivize upgrading guns to use technology, like biological indicators, to unlock the firearm.
Yang believes the use of guns to commit suicide is also an issue to be addressed.
TOM STEYER
The billionaire progressive activist and former hedge fund manager from San Francisco supports universal background checks, waiting periods for gun purchases, and bans on assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks.
Slideshow (7 Images)
He supports laws that allow courts to temporarily prohibit people likely to threaten others with guns from owning them.
Steyer calls for new laws closing loopholes in laws meant to prevent stalkers and domestic abusers from gaining access to guns. He says he would work with states to establish “high standards” for those seeking permission to carry concealed weapons in public.
Steyer would also ban the use of 3-D printers to make homemade guns.",[]

After all, the economy isn’t going to recover if millions are sick and people are afraid to leave their houses — and early evidence from the states that have tried to “reopen” their economies makes that clear.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/trumps-refusal-to-wear-a-mask-isnt-just-vanity-its-a-manifestation-of-his-fascism/,alternet,coronavirus,left,78,2,Biased,No agreement,"Despite knowing full well the furor that Vice President Mike Pence raised by not wearing a mask during a Mayo Clinic visit in late April, Donald Trump refused to wear a mask when visiting Honeywell factory in Arizona earlier this week — a factory that makes masks. This wasn’t just a symbolic nose-thumbing at people’s reasonable desire to be safe. Trump and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows were putting the lives of Honeywell employees in danger.
After all, masks are not primarily meant to protect the mask-wearer, but to protect others, since there’s clear evidence that people who are infected but have no symptoms can spread the coronavirus. Trump is regularly exposed to the virus, in fact — one of his personal valets just tested positive — and is a prime candidate to be such a carrier.
Of course Trump doesn’t care about other people, only his ego and his appearance. Reporting from the Associated Press confirms this, as a Thursday article explained Trump told advisers that wearing a mask would “send the wrong message.”
“The president said doing so would make it seem like he is preoccupied with health instead of focused on reopening the nation’s economy,” the AP reporters write.
This is another example of Trump’s false dichotomy between saving the economy and fighting the virus. After all, the economy isn’t going to recover if millions are sick and people are afraid to leave their houses — and early evidence from the states that have tried to “reopen” their economies makes that clear. But there’s also good reason to believe that the Trump-Pence antipathy to wearing masks signals to something deeper and darker.
Even before Trump started to make a big show out of not wearing a mask, it was common, at least in my South Philadelphia neighborhood, to see MAGA-hat-clad white men walking around without masks, delivering contemptuous sneers to the rest of us suckers who are covering our noses and mouths. Fox News host Laura Ingraham, in her friendly competition with fellow host Tucker Carlson to see who can be the most obnoxious, has started to demonize mask-wearing by claiming that public health advisories are somehow a conspiracy to sow “fear and intimidation.”
(Considering that mask-wearing to protect others took off in Asia long before Trump even ran for president, Ingraham’s conspiracy theory doesn’t possess even the most remote logical consistency.)
Between Trump and Fox News, the practice of mask-wearing is swiftly becoming another culture-war flashpoint. But the question is why. After all, masks seem to make people feel more comfortable with going out in public and going to work, and those are both things Trump dearly wants Americans to return to doing.
But Trump and his most ardent supporters seem almost physically repulsed at the very idea of wearing a mask. One Republican Ohio state legislator even claimed that since “we are all created in the image and likeness of God,” covering the face with a mask is an affront to God’s creation. (Many have noted that this same argument could be made against the practice of wearing pants.)
Ultimately, the rejection of mask-wearing really goes back to the fact that Trump, Ingraham and their most faithful followers are guided by fascist impulse, even when they don’t or can’t articulate a fully fleshed-out fascist ideology. Above all other things, the fascist personality is one that rejects even the possibility of sickness. To wear a mask is to publicly admit that one’s body is suspectible to illness, which is coded as “weak” and therefore unacceptable.
Natascha Strobl, an Austrian political scientist who is an expert in far-right organizing and rhetoric, had an important English-language Twitter thread in early April about why the far right was embracing the view that the coronavirus should simply be allowed to run wild. From the beginning, this has been the view Trump clearly prefers on an emotional level and has pushed federal policy toward all along. While Strobl didn’t mention masks, her observations also help explain why these same folks are repulsed by mask-wearing.
The fascist narrative, Strobl explained, is that “men aren’t men anymore, but nervous, urban, overly intellectualized and (here it comes) sickly weaklings.
“Weakness is never worthy of protection and has to be cast out. This is fascism,” she continues. The fascist believes that those viewed as “weak” have an obligation to die “without protest for the greater good” and that if “they don’t do it, they are weak and the weak drag everyone else down and therefore must be done away with.”
To wear a mask, in other words, indicates a belief that your personal body can become infected. A fascist-minded person like Trump cannot admit such a thing, either because he genuinely believes he is too strong to be affected by the virus or because he fears looking weak in public. Just as important, wearing a mask indicates care and concern for others, especially those who are high-risk. But the fascist-minded person doesn’t want to protect those viewed as “weak” — in fact, those people are expected to die so as not to be a burden on others. As Strobl points out, the far right believes that by becoming seriously ill or dying in service to some warped conception of the greater good, the “weak” can prove themselves strong through their sacrifice.
Trump hasn’t exactly concealed his impulse to see the coronavirus as a force that culls the herd of its weakest members, or to perceive that the “weak” can be redeemed through this morbid, sadistic ritual sacrifice. This week, he repeatedly insisted that Americans should think of themselves as “warriors” who bravely go forth and face the virus for the cause of, well, his re-election, which he is convinced depends on reopening the economy without bothering with the testing protocols, contact tracing and other precautions that could make doing so both safe and feasible.
(Even if people are willing to die for a noble cause, it’s worth pausing here and observing gently that Donald Trump’s re-election campaign is not such a cause.)
Moreover, Trump has always made a point of presenting himself as the fascist version of the Übermensch, even as he is likely too dim to know that word or what it signifies. Trump is forever bragging about his alleged “good genes,” which he often invokes as being so powerful as to render him a genius-level expert in any number of subjects, from medicine to economics to military strategy, without any need to do anything as weak and effeminate as learning stuff. Wearing a mask would go against his effort to present himself as possessing near-supernatural genetic powers to repel the sorts of viruses with which mere mortals must contend.
Of course, Trump doesn’t actually believe his own lies on this subject (nor on many others). As NBC News has reported, when Trump found out that a White House valet had the coronavirus, he became “lava level mad” at his staff and accused them of not doing enough to protect him. His public bravado is, as with all things Trump, a thin mask plastered over a deep well of insecurity. He may want you to believe his immune system is superhuman, but he knows full well that his obese and shattered 73-year-old physique puts him in the category of the high-risk people he and his fellow Republicans are treating as weaklings better off culled from the herd.
Unfortunately, because face masks have become such a potent symbol to far-right culture warriors of values they reject, such as equality and compassion, we can only expect the symbolic clash over masks to escalate. More and more conservatives, especially men, will try to prove their superior masculine strength and power by refusing to wear them. This is childish, selfish and entirely counterproductive, of course. What else can we expect from Trump and his followers, who are the real weaklings in this unhappy social equation?","['false', 'dichotomy']"
1576,The deepening economic crisis triggered by nationwide lockdowns to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus was underscored by other data on Thursday showing worker productivity fell at its fastest pace in more than four years in the first quarter amid the largest drop in hours since 2009.,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/u-s-unemployment-rolls-seen-swelling-as-coronavirus-restrictions-bite-idUSKBN22J0HT?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews,reuters,coronavirus,center,79,1,Non-biased,Entirely factual,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Millions more Americans sought unemployment benefits last week, suggesting layoffs broadened from consumer-facing industries to other segments of the economy and could remain elevated even as many parts of the country start to reopen.
The deepening economic crisis triggered by nationwide lockdowns to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus was underscored by other data on Thursday showing worker productivity fell at its fastest pace in more than four years in the first quarter amid the largest drop in hours since 2009.
The reports support economists’ expectations of a slow rebound in the economy after gross domestic product slumped in the first quarter at the steepest pace since the 2007-09 Great Recession. The economic rout could hurt President Donald Trump’s bid for a second term in the White House in November’s election.
Trump wants the country to reopen and restrictions imposed by states and local governments to control the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, eased.
“The U.S. labor market is in the worst position since the Great Depression and is unlikely to improve sustainably anytime soon,” said Ron Temple, head of U.S. equities at Lazard Asset Management in New York. “Premature efforts to reopen economies undermine our progress in controlling the pandemic and risk extending the duration of the downturn.”
Initial jobless claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 3.169 million for the week ended May 2. Data for the prior week was revised to show 7,000 more applications received than previously reported, taking the tally for that period to 3.846 million. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 3.0 million claims for the latest week.
It was the fifth straight weekly decrease in applications since the record 6.867 million in the week ended March 28. Florida accounted for about 40% of the decline in claims last week, which some economists attributed to difficulties processing applications. There were also big drops in filings in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Alabama, New York and Washington state.
Still, the latest numbers lifted to about 33.5 million the number of people who have filed claims for unemployment benefits since March 21, equivalent to roughly one out of every five workers losing their job in just over a month.
“The pace of new claims for unemployment is slowing, but remains at levels unimaginable just a few months ago,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. “Even with the economy slowly starting to reopen, the number of unemployed should continue to rise sharply as governments, as well as businesses that have tried but not succeeded at holding the line, are now laying off workers.”
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, decreased at a 2.5% annualized rate in the first quarter. That was the largest decline since the fourth quarter of 2015 and followed a 1.2% pace of increase in the fourth quarter.
Hours worked tumbled at a 3.8% rate last quarter, the sharpest decline since the third quarter of 2009. Hours worked increased at a 1.2% rate in the fourth quarter.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as investors focused on a surprise rise in Chinese exports and a surge in oil prices. The dollar .DXY firmed against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
EMPLOYMENT REPORT AWAITED
Thursday’s weekly claims data will have no impact on the Labor Department’s comprehensive employment report for April, which is scheduled to be released on Friday, as it falls outside the period during which the government surveyed establishments and households for its monthly report. A survey on Wednesday showed private payrolls fell by a record 20.2 million in April.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls are forecast to have plunged by a historic 22 million in April, which would blow away the record dive of 800,000 seen during the 2007-2009 recession. Employment dropped by 701,000 jobs in March, ending a record streak of gains dating to September 2010.
The unemployment rate is seen jumping to 16% in April, which would shatter the post-World War Two record of 10.8% touched in November 1982. The jobless rate in March shot up 0.9 percentage point to 4.4%, the largest monthly change since January 1975.
April could, however, mark the trough in job losses as more small businesses access their portion of an almost $3 trillion fiscal package, which made provisions for them to get loans that could be partially forgiven if they were used for employee salaries. At least 30 states are partially reopening, which could see some of the unemployed going back to work.
“We lost a lot of jobs all at once, but we will be regaining a lot of jobs all at once too as large companies reopen,” Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia said on Fox Business Network.

The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid surged 4.636 million to a record 22.647 million in the week ended April 25. The so-called continuing claims data is reported with a one-week lag and will be closely watched in the coming months to get a better sense of the depth of the labor market downturn.
The Labor Department also reported that nearly a million people had their applications for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) processed in the week ending April 18.
The PUA program covers gig workers and many others who do not qualify for regular insurance unemployment, but have been forced out of work because of COVID-19. Another 1.4 million workers have sought benefits under this program since April 18.",['triggered']

Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun has been at Bangkok’s international airport since Saturday when she arrived from Kuwait, saying she fears her family will kill her if she is forced to return home. Her relatives have not commented on her accusations of abuse and Reuters was not able to reach them.
The case has drawn new global attention to Saudi Arabia’s strict social rules, including a requirement that women have the permission of a male “guardian” to travel, which rights groups say can trap women and girls as prisoners of abusive families.
It comes at a time when Riyadh is facing unusually intense scrutiny from its Western allies over the killing of a journalist at its consulate in Istanbul in October and over the humanitarian consequences of its war in Yemen.
Thai immigration officials had planned to put Qunun on a flight back to Kuwait on Monday, but relented after her online pleas drew international attention.
She told Reuters via text and audio messages she had fled Kuwait during a family visit there, and had planned to travel to Australia to seek asylum. She said she was held after leaving her plane in Bangkok and told she would be sent back to Kuwait.
“They will kill me,” Qunun told Reuters. “My life is in danger. My family threatens to kill me for the most trivial things.”
A representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) met Qunun at the airport and also discussed the case with Thai immigration officials. After the meeting, Thailand’s immigration chief said she would not be expelled.
“We will take her into Bangkok and provide her with safe shelter under the care of the UNHCR,” immigration chief Surachate Hakparn told reporters on Monday evening.

He said the UNHCR would work on processing Qunun’s request for refugee status. Giuseppe de Vincentis, the UNHCR representative in Thailand, said the Thai government had given assurances Qunun would not be expelled to any country where she might be in danger while her case was being processed.
“PHYISICAL, EMOTIONAL ABUSE”
Qunun posted a video on Twitter on Monday of her barricading her hotel door with a table and a mattress. She said her family was powerful in Saudi society but she did not identify them.
Asked why she was seeking refuge in Australia, she told Reuters: “Physical, emotional and verbal abuse and being imprisoned inside the house for months. They threaten to kill me and prevent me from continuing my education.
“They won’t let me drive or travel. I am oppressed. I love life and work and I am very ambitious but my family is preventing me from living.”
The Saudi foreign ministry said in a tweet that its embassy was in touch with the woman’s father and the Thai government, but its diplomats had not met or communicated with her.
New York-based Human Rights Watch said Thailand should not send Qunun back to her family because she says she faces danger.
Qunun said she had obtained an Australian visa and booked a flight. She said she had planned to spend a few days in Thailand so she would not spark suspicion when she left Kuwait.
Thai immigration chief Surachate, however, said that Qunun did not have a visa for Australia. The Australian Embassy said it had no immediate comment.

Contradicting earlier accounts from Thai officials, Surachate said Thai authorities had been contacted by the Saudis before deciding to deny Qunun entry to the country.
“The Saudi Arabia embassy contacted the immigration police ... and said that the girl had run away from her parents and they fear for her safety,” he said.
“We acknowledged this and checked her paperwork. She had a passport but no return ticket, no travel plan, and no destination or hotel reservation in Thailand ... so per airport security procedures, immigration denied her entry.”",[]

Here is a look at gun control positions taken by Trump and the Democrats vying to unseat him.
DONALD TRUMP
In a speech shortly after two mass shootings last summer, Trump proposed tighter monitoring of the internet, mental health reform and wider use of the death penalty as a response to the shootings. He suggested he might support background checks for gun purchases.
But on Jan. 20, in advance of a Virginia rally by gun enthusiasts and militia members who oppose background checks for gun purchasers and other firearms restrictions that are being considered in the state, Trump criticized the reforms on Twitter.
“Your 2nd Amendment is under very serious attack in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia,” Trump wrote.
JOE BIDEN
Biden, who served as vice president under Democratic President Barack Obama from 2009-2017, supports renewing an expired assault weapons ban imposed in the 1990s. He has also called for a federal gun buyback program to reduce the number of weapons on the street.
Like other Democratic candidates, Biden supports universal background checks for gun sales. He would ban those convicted of hate crimes from owning or buying guns.
In addition to more background checks, Biden advocates so-called “smart guns” that require owners’ biometrics to pull the trigger.
BERNIE SANDERS
Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, supports universal background checks, a ban on the sale and distribution of assault weapons, a crackdown on straw purchases of guns for criminals, and the prohibition of high-capacity ammunition magazines.
He also supports so-called red flag laws, under which a court could take away guns from people deemed by a judge to be likely to hurt others with firearms, including stalkers and those accused of domestic abuse. He would ban the 3-D printing of firearms and bump stocks, which speed up the firing of semi-automatic weapons.
Sanders has called on the Republican-controlled Senate to vote on a bill requiring a background check on every gun sale and transfer, which passed the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives last year.
ELIZABETH WARREN
Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, has promised to send comprehensive gun violence prevention legislation to Congress within her first 100 days in office. She backs requiring universal background checks for gun purchasers, reporting mass purchases of firearms and raising the minimum age to own a gun to 18.
She says she would investigate the finances of the powerful gun rights lobbying organization, the National Rifle Association, and revoke licenses for gun dealers who make sales that do not comply with federal laws. She would expand rules meant to prevent gun violence by those suspected of domestic abuse.
Warren supports reinstating the federal assault weapons ban and creating a federal licensing system that requires gun owners to register their firearms.
PETE BUTTIGIEG
The former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Buttigieg supports universal background checks, banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and red flag laws that disarm domestic abusers and others ruled by a judge to be at high risk of harming others with a gun.
Buttigieg would require people to notify law enforcement if their guns are lost or stolen. Like several of his rivals, Buttigieg supports giving the FBI longer than the current three days to conduct a background check. He would close the “boyfriend loophole” by expanding a law restricting gun purchases by perpetrators of spousal abuse and would prohibit guns made without serial numbers or on 3D printers.
AMY KLOBUCHAR
Klobuchar, a U.S. senator from Minnesota, backs universal background checks, banning bump stocks that allow weapons to fire 700 rounds per minute and banning high-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.
She would fight for an assault weapons ban while more immediately raising the minimum age to buy such weapons from 18 to 21. She would prevent people with severe mental illness from acquiring guns and establish a waiting period for sales of handguns and assault rifles. She would prohibit the online publication of computer codes used for 3-D printing of firearms.
She authored legislation, stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate, to close the so-called “boyfriend loophole.”
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG
The billionaire former mayor of New York has long backed stricter firearms laws, co-founding or championing gun control groups, including Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Moms Demand Action and Everytown for Gun Safety. He spent $110 million backing gun safety candidates in the 2018 election cycle, his campaign website says.
Bloomberg backs universal background checks, reinstating the federal assault weapons ban and prohibiting the sale of high-capacity magazines. He would raise the age to legally purchase handguns and semi-automatic weapons to 21 and temporarily ban gun possession by people convicted of assault and other violent crimes.
He would ban all guns at schools, colleges and universities except for those used by law enforcement. He would also extend beyond spouses a law meant to protect victims of domestic abuse.
ANDREW YANG
Yang, a businessman, has backed comprehensive gun control measures including an assault weapon ban and prohibiting high-capacity magazines.
He supports creating a tax credit to incentivize upgrading guns to use technology, like biological indicators, to unlock the firearm.
Yang believes the use of guns to commit suicide is also an issue to be addressed.
TOM STEYER
The billionaire progressive activist and former hedge fund manager from San Francisco supports universal background checks, waiting periods for gun purchases, and bans on assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks.
Slideshow (7 Images)
He supports laws that allow courts to temporarily prohibit people likely to threaten others with guns from owning them.
Steyer calls for new laws closing loopholes in laws meant to prevent stalkers and domestic abusers from gaining access to guns. He says he would work with states to establish “high standards” for those seeking permission to carry concealed weapons in public.
Steyer would also ban the use of 3-D printers to make homemade guns.",[]

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Monday that President Donald Trump was not firing U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci despite his retweet of a supporter’s #FireFauci message.

While all three major U.S. stock indexes ended the session solidly higher, they see-sawed for much of the day, with reopening state economies and the possibility of additional stimulus doing battle with revived trade war fears and bleak economic data.
“This market is a battle over time frames,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. “Those pushing the market up believe we’re going to get a vaccine in a reasonable amount of time, the economy isn’t totally going to fall apart, that unemployment is not going to spike appreciably higher.”
“On days when (the market is) pushed down, the naysayers come to the forefront, when it bounces back up the more optimistic investors see an opportunity,” Ghriskey added.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court struck down the governor’s lockdown orders, fueling hopes that mandated restrictions could be lifted sooner rather than later.
But an ousted health official testified before a U.S. House of Representatives panel that the United States could face “the darkest winter” if its response to the pandemic failed to improve.
Comments by Trump late Wednesday blamed China for the coronavirus outbreak and revived trade war fears, even as mandated lockdowns continue to damage the economy.
That damage was in evidence in a report from the U.S. Labor Department, which showed just under 3 million new jobless claims last week, pushing the seven-week tally well over 36 million.
A White House spokeswoman said Trump is open to another possible stimulus bill, but will not sign the bill put forward by House of Representatives Democrats.
“One of the major parts of the House bill is support for state and local governments and that’s critical for state institutions that are really hurt by this pandemic,” Ghriskey added.

Convicted Russian agent Maria Butina is accompanied by federal agents after her release from a Florida prison, during her transfer onto a jet bound for Moscow at Miami International Airport in Miami, Florida, U.S. October 25, 2019. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement/Handout via REUTERS.
Butina, 31, had been scheduled for release from the low-security prison in Tallahassee in early November, but a change in federal law moved up her release date based on credit for good behavior, her attorney Robert Driscoll said.
A prison official confirmed she was released on Friday morning and taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) authorities.
She left Miami International Airport on a direct flight to Moscow at about 6 p.m. (2200 GMT), ICE said in a statement.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously expressed “outrage” over Butina’s prison sentence and said she did not carry out any orders from Russian security services.
Butina, a former graduate student at American University in Washington who publicly advocated for gun rights, pleaded guilty in December to one count of conspiring to act as a foreign agent and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.
The Siberia native admitted to conspiring with a Russian official and two Americans to infiltrate the National Rifle Association, a group closely aligned with U.S. conservatives and Republican politicians including President Donald Trump, and create unofficial lines of communication to try to shape Washington’s policy toward Moscow.
Her 18-month sentence included nine months she spent incarcerated after her July 2018 arrest.
Butina’s case was separate from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, which detailed numerous contacts between Trump’s campaign and Russia. Her activities occurred during the same period as the contacts investigated by Mueller.
RUSSIAN OFFICIAL
The Russian official with whom Butina conspired was later identified as Alexander Torshin, a deputy governor of Russia’s central bank. He was never charged in the case, but was hit with sanctions by the U.S. Treasury Department.
One of the two Americans referenced in her case was conservative political activist Paul Erickson, her boyfriend. Erickson was not charged for his links to Butina, but was indicted on unrelated wire fraud and money laundering charges in South Dakota. The case against Erickson is still pending.
In addition, Overstock.com (OSTK.O) Chief Executive Officer Patrick Byrne resigned in August after confirming a report by Fox News contributor Sara Carter that he also had an intimate relationship with Butina.
Federal prosecutors have said Butina did not engage in “traditional” spy craft, but worked behind the scenes to make inroads in conservative political circles and promote friendlier U.S.-Russian relations. She arranged dinners in Washington and New York and attended events to meet prominent politicians.
Butina in 2015 appeared at a Trump campaign event and asked him a question about whether he wanted better relations with Russia. Trump responded by telling Butina that he would “get along very nicely with Putin.”
Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs last year accused the United States of forcing Butina to make a false confession to “absolutely ridiculous charges” of being a Russian agent.
“It’s not clear what she was convicted of or what crime she committed,” Putin said in April. “I think it’s a prime example of ‘saving face.’ They arrested her and put the girl in jail. But there was nothing on her, so in order not to look totally stupid they gave her, fixed her up, with an 18-month sentence to show that she was guilty of something.”

Justice Sonia Sotomayor has not yet acted on another similar request. The ban goes into effect on Tuesday but lower courts have yet to rule on an appeals brought by gun rights activists in Michigan and the U.S. capital.
Trump pledged to ban the devices soon after a gunman used them to shoot and kill 58 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas in October 2017. The Justice Department on Dec. 18 announced plans to implement the policy.
A Washington-based federal district court judge in February upheld the ban, prompting gun rights advocates to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That court heard oral arguments on Friday but has not yet ruled. The appeals court, however, say that the ban cannot go into effect in relation to the specific individuals and groups challenging it.
The action by Roberts concerned only the Washington case. The challengers in the Washington case include individual gun owners and gun rights groups such as the Firearms Policy Foundation and Florida Carry Inc.
In the Michigan case, a federal district court judge last week ruled in favor of the administration. The challengers include individuals and the gun rights group Gun Owners of America. The Cincinnati, Ohio-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday refused to put the ban on hold pending appeal.
Sotomayor is now weighing an emergency request in that case.
On the day the administration announced plans to put the policy in place, gun rights advocates sued in federal court to challenge it. They have argued that the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) lacks the authority to equate bump stocks with machine guns under decades-old law.
One of the laws at the center of the legal dispute was written more than 80 years ago, when Congress restricted access to machine guns during the heyday of American gangsters’ use of “tommy guns.”",[]
1626,Assad has been at war with the rebels since 2011 and has been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons against civilians and other human rights atrocities to cement his control over regions that oppose his rule.,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/m-blC792hwU/,breitbart,international-politics-and-world-news,right,82,1,Biased,Entirely factual,"The United Nations Humanitarian Affairs office warned on Monday that nearly a million Syrian civilians from northwest Idlib province had been displaced in a Russia-backed offensive there by dictator Bashar al-Assad that began in December.
Idlib is the last stronghold of the anti-Assad rebel movement in the country. Assad has been at war with the rebels since 2011 and has been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons against civilians and other human rights atrocities to cement his control over regions that oppose his rule. Conversely, rebel groups have faced allegations that they have cooperated with Sunni jihadist organizations, as the anti-Assad movement largely consists of Arab Sunnis opposed to the Shiite Alawite rule in Damascus.
While the struggle between Assad and Sunni rebels lies at the heart of the Syrian Civil War, as many as ten different factions have participated in violence in the country during the war, often unrelated to Assad such as the failed establishment of the Islamic State caliphate in Raqqa or clashes between the northern Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG/YPJ) and the Turkish military. Turkey claims to oppose Assad’s rule but has instead focused its energy on fighting the Kurds, who have not had any significant interaction with Assad’s army and instead largely contributed to the demise of ISIS.
The vacuum left by the fall of ISIS in the country has allowed Assad, along with allies Iran and Russia, to focus on attacking Idlib.
“The violence in north-west Syria is indiscriminate,” Mark Lowcock, U.N. Humanitarian Affairs chief, said on Monday. “We are now receiving reports that settlements for displaced people are being hit, resulting in deaths, injuries and further displacement.”
Refugees from the region “are traumatized and forced to sleep outside in freezing temperatures because camps are full,” he noted. “Mothers are burning plastic to keep children warm … babies and small children are dying because of the cold.”
Lowcock added that schools, hospitals, and other critical infrastructure has been destroyed. Exposure to nature while fleeing also leaves open the potential of a significant public health crisis in the event of disease spreading, he added.
He estimated that 900,000 people had been displaced since December 1. A week ago, the number of displaced in the region stood at 690,000 since December 1, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which estimated it was the largest number of displaced people in a single period of the Syrian Civil War. The sum is particularly jarring given that the U.N. estimates the Idlib region is home to 3 million people.
Lowcock urged U.N. Security Council action and a ceasefire to protect civilians.
Anadolu Agency, the state news agency of anti-Assad Turkey, claimed this week that the number was much higher – nearly 2 million displaced from Idlib since January. Anadolu claimed that rebels and Assad troops had declared a ceasefire recently that Assad had not respected; President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has threatened more military action against Assad in the near future.
As of this week, the United Nations estimates that over 5.6 million people have left Syria since the war began in 2011. Another 6.6 million are internally displaced, meaning they have lost their homes to the war and are either living homeless in cities or living in overcrowded refugee camps. The vast majority of those, over 3 million, who have left the country have fled to Turkey. Others in the new wave of displaced have fled to Manbij, Syrian Kurdistan. Local forces affiliated with the Kurdish fighters there have reported numbers too large to count of incoming refugees this month.
The Russian government has previously responded to United Nations reports on its atrocities in Syria by dismissing their information as false.
“They say the particular date a school or a hospital was destroyed in a particular region. They give coordinates. Our people start to double-check this and they find that there is no hospital with such coordinates, there is no school with such coordinates and the day which is mentioned by the U.N. humanitarian agencies, on this day, the Russian air force did not act at all,” Russian United Nations representative Gennady Gatilov complained in August, in response to yet another U.N. report accusing Moscow of helping Assad attack civilians. Gatilov claimed that biased NGOs on the ground provided the U.N. with misinformation.
This week, Russia has focused instead of accusing the United States of human rights violations.
“The oil fields … are controlled by the U.S. There’s shameless, impudent pillage of the wealth that belongs to Syria and the Syrian people taking place,” Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu claimed in Rome this week, referring to territories liberated from the Islamic State and managed by Syrian Kurdish groups.
The Assad regime’s state propaganda outlet, the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), claimed that, rather than terrorizing civilians, Assad has instead created a “humanitarian corridor” in Idlib for those who wish to leave.
“SANA reporter said that tens of citizens, most of them women, children, and elderly persons, exited through the humanitarian corridor established by the Syrian Arab Army west the liberated city of Ma’arat al-Nu’man, coming from the areas where the terrorists are positioned,” the outlet reported. SANA uses the term “liberated” to refer to cities under Assad control.
SANA also claimed Assad was providing medicine and food.

1633,The U.S. president has come under sustained criticism for his racially incendiary rhetoric since launching his candidacy in 2015 — including his repeated use of the word “invasion” to describe immigration along the U.S.-Mexico border.,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-white-nationalism-insight/el-paso-massacre-upends-white-nationalists-normalization-strategy-idUSKCN1UY2B5,reuters,white-nationalism,center,82,1,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"RUSSELLVILLE, ARK. (Reuters) - Two years ago, America’s white nationalist movement stunned the country. Neo-Nazi demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, had turned deadly when a far-right protester drove a car through a crowd, killing one and injuring dozens. Some movement leaders regrouped. Instead of stoking outrage, they set out to build support with another tack: Looking normal.

The larger goal was what many white nationalists call “Phase 2” — gaining mainstream acceptance for far-right ideas widely rejected as repugnant and getting white nationalists into positions of influence. The normalization effort included softened rhetoric and social gatherings that, for many groups, would increasingly replace confrontational rallies.
“The strategy is internally focused now — having families get together,” said alt-right blogger Brad Griffin, a self-avowed white nationalist from Montgomery, Alabama. He fondly recalled a river-tubing trip he organized in 2018 for friends who had attended a local white nationalist conference. The goal of such low-key gatherings, he said, is to spread far-right ideology away from the public spectacle of a public protest. “It’s a lot more fun to do that than to go out and tangle with Antifa” — members of America’s far-left “anti-fascist” movement — “and get hit with piss balloons in the street.”
(INTERACTIVE: tmsnrt.rs/2MXA7kL)
Griffin spoke in an interview before last weekend’s massacre in El Paso, Texas — an event that has scrambled the calculus for the movement’s aspiring normalizers.
On Saturday, authorities say, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius shot and killed 22 people and wounded two dozen more shortly after a manifesto appeared online explaining his motivation and decrying a “Hispanic invasion” of the United States.
The El Paso attack has also put new pressure on a man some white nationalists praise as helping advance their movement: Donald Trump. The U.S. president has come under sustained criticism for his racially incendiary rhetoric since launching his candidacy in 2015 — including his repeated use of the word “invasion” to describe immigration along the U.S.-Mexico border.
On Monday, Trump issued his most forceful disavowal of white supremacism to date. “In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy,” Trump said in response to the weekend’s shootings. “These sinister ideologies must be defeated.”
After Charlottesville, the lie-low approach was seen as a necessity by some in the movement. Many white nationalist groups were sued and lost access to social media, which has caused them to avoid public confrontations, said Heidi Beirich, who studies far-right groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit civil rights organization that tracks extremists.
“We haven’t seen many rallies since Charlottesville,” she said. The combination of bad press, prosecutions and lost access to social media, has “depressed people in the movement” and created a sense that “maybe the softer approach is the way to go.”
The shootings, and Trump’s repudiation, leave the normalizers in a difficult, perhaps impossible spot. Their gambit was always a stretch.
A Reuters photojournalist has observed the approach up close — at a children’s nursery in a “church” run by the Ku Klux Klan (KKK); a restaurant-and-bar that caters to white supremacists in Georgia; a barbecue held in Arkansas by the ShieldWall Network, a self-avowed neo-Nazi group with dozens of members. Even as they described their hopes of mainstreaming, many members of these and other groups also voiced the violent tropes that animate the movement.
(WIDER IMAGE photo essay: reut.rs/2KnI80l )
One is the so-called Great Replacement conspiracy theory, common in white nationalist circles, which holds that leftist elites are engineering the replacement of white majorities globally through policies that encourage mass migrations as white birth rates decline. The manifesto tied to the El Paso shooting referenced the replacement theory in explaining why the shooter chose to kill Hispanic people.
Asked in a May interview how whites could regain demographic dominance, ShieldWall’s leader, Billy Roper, told Reuters that promoting a higher birth rate among white people is helpful, but “bullets” would be faster. Roper said his organization doesn’t advocate anything illegal but that he “couldn’t disagree” with the goals of the mass shooter who murdered 51 people at two Muslim mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March. That killer, too, had cited the replacement theory as a motive.
In a phone interview after the Texas massacre, Roper said he didn’t support the killings. But the victims, Roper said, “were just pawns in the Jewish game of demographic replacement of whites,” adding that such “cultural conflicts” are an “unfortunate fact of modern life” in an increasingly diverse nation moving closer to racial “balkanization.”
The strategy of trying to couch such extreme views in mainstream rhetoric is not new. One of the highest-profile examples of the normalization tack is that of David Duke, a former KKK grand wizard who traded the klan’s signature white robes and pointy hats for a business suit, adopted more mainstream conservative talking points, and made the runoff election for Louisiana governor in 1991. Duke lost by a wide margin but drew support from about half the state’s white voters.
The normalization effort is also not universal. Some far-right groups are still known for confrontation, including the Proud Boys, who last October fought with people protesting a Republican Club event in New York City.
Members of the National Socialist Movement, a neo-Nazi group, carry guns and other weapons (left) as they gather in a parking lot before attending a rally at the state capitol in Little Rock, Arkansas, in November 2018. The group was protesting what it called the “white genocide” taking place in South Africa.
In Draketown, Georgia, Pat Lanzo runs a restaurant-and-bar that white supremacists have claimed as their own. Lanzo insists the Georgia Peach Oyster Bar is merely a celebration of free speech.
“We’re not racist,” he said. “We hate everyone equally.”
The decor inside his bar is filled with the kind of racist tropes that remain a hard sell with mainstream America. His menus feature a drawing of a Klan member relaxing on a hammock made of two lynched black corpses tied together at the feet. And Lanzo has rented his property to neo-Nazis and klan members for cross burnings, a traditional show of force by the KKK in the American South.
The image-scrubbing by today’s white nationalists belies a long history of violence by far-right ideologues. In the ten years ending in 2018, murderers motivated by far-right ideology took the lives of 124 people in 62 incidents, according to the U.S. Extremist Crime Database, a collaboration of criminal justice researchers from multiple universities. The statistics include white supremacists but also those with other far-right agendas that are not focused on race, such as anti-government militants.
Thomas Robb, the national director of The Knights Party, a group formerly named the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, said the movement should think beyond confrontations and rallies.
“When the rally’s over, what do you do?” said Robb in an interview before the El Paso shootings. “Our goal isn’t so much to get membership, but influence. When people come to our website, they see responsible people who aren’t using the ‘N word’ in every sentence.” Instead, Robb said, the aim is to “speak like Corporate America” as a way to make far-right ideas more palatable to a broader audience.
White nationalists have always debated whether putting “reasonable clothing” on their movement would get them further than street clashes and violence, said Mike German, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning policy institute. But the approach appears to have gained momentum under Trump in part because of the president’s racially divisive rhetoric, said German, who previously spent years undercover with white nationalists as an agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
“Before, white nationalists were trying to shove their way into the mainstream,” German said. “Now, they’re being invited in.”
It’s far from clear whether many true believers are ready for life in the mainstream.
This past April in Russellville, Arkansas, a lakeside college town, three members of the ShieldWall Network gathered to rent a houseboat and cruise around Lake Dardanelle. A Reuters photojournalist went with them.
Moods were light; they toasted one another with Fireball whiskey shots, laughed when one of them dropped his phone in the lake and cooed as another cuddled with his pregnant wife. Later that night, the group would initiate a new recruit, Nicholas Holloway, and burn wooden swastikas.
Two months later, in June, Holloway and two other ShieldWall members on the boat that day — Julian Calfy and John Carollo — were arrested for allegedly beating a gay man and holding a gun to his head after luring him to Calfy’s home with a false dating advertisement, according to police reports. Calfy remains in jail, while the other two members are free on bail, according to a spokesman for the Pope County, Arkansas, Sheriff’s Office. Each is charged with third-degree battery, first-degree terroristic threatening and first-degree criminal mischief in connection with the attack.
Neither the defendants nor their attorneys could be reached for comment.

Griffin, the alt-right blogger, condemned the El Paso shooting in stronger terms than other extremists who spoke to Reuters, calling it and other mass shootings by avowed white nationalists “insane tragedies.”
At the same time, Griffin said he supported resegregation of the races, echoing one of the core principles of the manifesto that authorities tied to the Texas shooter.
The continuing violence, he said, undermines any attempt by the movement to gain more mainstream acceptance. At this point, he said, most white nationalists would rather just “stay out of the debate.”","['incendiary', 'rhetoric', 'racially']"

(Reuters) - Two years ago, America’s white nationalist movement stunned the country. Neo-Nazi demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, had turned deadly when a far-right protester drove a car through a crowd, killing one and injuring dozens. Some movement leaders regrouped. Instead of stoking outrage, they set out to build support with another tack: Looking normal.

The larger goal was what many white nationalists call “Phase 2” — gaining mainstream acceptance for far-right ideas widely rejected as repugnant and getting white nationalists into positions of influence. The normalization effort included softened rhetoric and social gatherings that, for many groups, would increasingly replace confrontational rallies.
“The strategy is internally focused now — having families get together,” said alt-right blogger Brad Griffin, a self-avowed white nationalist from Montgomery, Alabama. He fondly recalled a river-tubing trip he organized in 2018 for friends who had attended a local white nationalist conference. The goal of such low-key gatherings, he said, is to spread far-right ideology away from the public spectacle of a public protest. “It’s a lot more fun to do that than to go out and tangle with Antifa” — members of America’s far-left “anti-fascist” movement — “and get hit with piss balloons in the street.”

Griffin spoke in an interview before last weekend’s massacre in El Paso, Texas — an event that has scrambled the calculus for the movement’s aspiring normalizers.
On Saturday, authorities say, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius shot and killed 22 people and wounded two dozen more shortly after a manifesto appeared online explaining his motivation and decrying a “Hispanic invasion” of the United States.
The El Paso attack has also put new pressure on a man some white nationalists praise as helping advance their movement: Donald Trump. The U.S. president has come under sustained criticism for his racially incendiary rhetoric since launching his candidacy in 2015 — including his repeated use of the word “invasion” to describe immigration along the U.S.-Mexico border.
On Monday, Trump issued his most forceful disavowal of white supremacism to date. “In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy,” Trump said in response to the weekend’s shootings. “These sinister ideologies must be defeated.”
After Charlottesville, the lie-low approach was seen as a necessity by some in the movement. Many white nationalist groups were sued and lost access to social media, which has caused them to avoid public confrontations, said Heidi Beirich, who studies far-right groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit civil rights organization that tracks extremists.
“We haven’t seen many rallies since Charlottesville,” she said. The combination of bad press, prosecutions and lost access to social media, has “depressed people in the movement” and created a sense that “maybe the softer approach is the way to go.”
The shootings, and Trump’s repudiation, leave the normalizers in a difficult, perhaps impossible spot. Their gambit was always a stretch.
A Reuters photojournalist has observed the approach up close — at a children’s nursery in a “church” run by the Ku Klux Klan (KKK); a restaurant-and-bar that caters to white supremacists in Georgia; a barbecue held in Arkansas by the ShieldWall Network, a self-avowed neo-Nazi group with dozens of members. Even as they described their hopes of mainstreaming, many members of these and other groups also voiced the violent tropes that animate the movement.
(WIDER IMAGE photo essay: reut.rs/2KnI80l )
One is the so-called Great Replacement conspiracy theory, common in white nationalist circles, which holds that leftist elites are engineering the replacement of white majorities globally through policies that encourage mass migrations as white birth rates decline. The manifesto tied to the El Paso shooting referenced the replacement theory in explaining why the shooter chose to kill Hispanic people.
Asked in a May interview how whites could regain demographic dominance, ShieldWall’s leader, Billy Roper, told Reuters that promoting a higher birth rate among white people is helpful, but “bullets” would be faster. Roper said his organization doesn’t advocate anything illegal but that he “couldn’t disagree” with the goals of the mass shooter who murdered 51 people at two Muslim mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March. That killer, too, had cited the replacement theory as a motive.
In a phone interview after the Texas massacre, Roper said he didn’t support the killings. But the victims, Roper said, “were just pawns in the Jewish game of demographic replacement of whites,” adding that such “cultural conflicts” are an “unfortunate fact of modern life” in an increasingly diverse nation moving closer to racial “balkanization.”
The strategy of trying to couch such extreme views in mainstream rhetoric is not new. One of the highest-profile examples of the normalization tack is that of David Duke, a former KKK grand wizard who traded the klan’s signature white robes and pointy hats for a business suit, adopted more mainstream conservative talking points, and made the runoff election for Louisiana governor in 1991. Duke lost by a wide margin but drew support from about half the state’s white voters.
The normalization effort is also not universal. Some far-right groups are still known for confrontation, including the Proud Boys, who last October fought with people protesting a Republican Club event in New York City.

The group was protesting what it called the “white genocide” taking place in South Africa.
In Draketown, Georgia, Pat Lanzo runs a restaurant-and-bar that white supremacists have claimed as their own. Lanzo insists the Georgia Peach Oyster Bar is merely a celebration of free speech.
“We’re not racist,” he said. “We hate everyone equally.”
The decor inside his bar is filled with the kind of racist tropes that remain a hard sell with mainstream America. His menus feature a drawing of a Klan member relaxing on a hammock made of two lynched black corpses tied together at the feet. And Lanzo has rented his property to neo-Nazis and klan members for cross burnings, a traditional show of force by the KKK in the American South.
The image-scrubbing by today’s white nationalists belies a long history of violence by far-right ideologues. In the ten years ending in 2018, murderers motivated by far-right ideology took the lives of 124 people in 62 incidents, according to the U.S. Extremist Crime Database, a collaboration of criminal justice researchers from multiple universities. The statistics include white supremacists but also those with other far-right agendas that are not focused on race, such as anti-government militants.
Thomas Robb, the national director of The Knights Party, a group formerly named the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, said the movement should think beyond confrontations and rallies.
“When the rally’s over, what do you do?” said Robb in an interview before the El Paso shootings. “Our goal isn’t so much to get membership, but influence. When people come to our website, they see responsible people who aren’t using the ‘N word’ in every sentence.” Instead, Robb said, the aim is to “speak like Corporate America” as a way to make far-right ideas more palatable to a broader audience.
White nationalists have always debated whether putting “reasonable clothing” on their movement would get them further than street clashes and violence, said Mike German, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning policy institute. But the approach appears to have gained momentum under Trump in part because of the president’s racially divisive rhetoric, said German, who previously spent years undercover with white nationalists as an agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
“Before, white nationalists were trying to shove their way into the mainstream,” German said. “Now, they’re being invited in.”

1663,"The Citibank and Bank of America examples are just the tip of the iceberg, and do not even begin to reveal the larger financial shenanigans against gun makers via Operation Choke Point.",,breitbart,gun-control,right,84,1,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Nineteen Republican Senators signed a letter to Treasury Sec. Steve Mnuchin, alerting him that financial institutions might use recovery funds to target gun companies.
The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) reports that U.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) spearheaded the effort to warn Mnuchin not simply that the efforts against gun companies could occur, but are fully expected.
The letter said, “A small but vocal minority has weaponized federally-backed banks against politically-disfavored businesses that operate in good faith and compliance with the law, by denying them financial services based on political reasons that have nothing to do with creditworthiness.”
The Senators listed a number of bans, Citibank and Bank of America JP Morgan Chase among them, as examples of financial institutions that have previously put special rules or corporate gun controls in place for businesses in the firearms industry.
NSSF explained:
These banks has taken discriminatory stances against the firearms industry, denying financial services unless manufacturers and retailers adopt their views on gun control. It isn’t just the firearm industry that’s been victimized by the corporate virtue signalers. These banking institutions, along with credit card processors and financial service providers, also targeted the oil and gas industry, coal, private corrections and other politically disfavored industries.
On March 23, 2018, Breitbart News reported that Citibank had unveiled a new “Commercial Firearms Policy,” aimed at denying business to members of the firearms industry who refused to enact corporate gun controls urged by Citibank.
On April 13, 2018, Reuters reported that Bank of America was reworking their policy so as to end business with customers “who make military-style firearms for civilians.” Bank of America does not differentiate between the fact that military rifles are fully automatic, whereas civilian firearms are only semiautomatic.
The Citibank and Bank of America examples are just the tip of the iceberg, and do not even begin to reveal the larger financial shenanigans against gun makers via Operation Choke Point.
On January 8, 2014, Breitbart News reported that President Obama’s Operation Choke Point pressured credit processors and certain lenders against doing business with gun manufacturers.

WASHINGTON, April 30 (Reuters) - There is a growing push within the Trump administration to craft a list of retaliatory measures against China over its role in the coronavirus outbreak, three sources, including a U.S. official, familiar with the matter said, but cautioned the efforts were in early stages.
President Donald Trump has shown increasing frustration with China in recent weeks over the pandemic, which has cost tens of thousands of lives in the United States alone, sparked an economic contraction and threatened Trump’s chances of re-election in November.
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that a range of options were under discussion but that it had not yet reached the level of Trump’s top national security team or been taken to the president.
A range of options are being discussed, informally for now by officials across an array of government agencies, including the State Department, White House National Security Council, Treasury Department and Pentagon, two of the sources said.
“There is a discussion as to how hard to hit China and how to calibrate it properly,” one of the sources said as Washington walks a tight rope in its ties with Beijing while it imports personal protection equipment (PPE) from there and is also wary of hurting a sensitive trade deal.
The Washington Post, citing two people with knowledge of internal discussions, reported on Thursday that some administration officials had discussed the idea of canceling some debt held by China as a way to strike at Beijing for perceived shortfalls in its candidness on the COVID-19 pandemic.
Trump’s top economic adviser denied the report. “The full faith and credit of U.S. debt obligations is sacrosanct. Period. Full stop,” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Reuters. “Similarly is the reserve currency status of the U.S. dollar,” Kudlow said. “The story’s completely wrong.”
Trump told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday that he was looking at different options in terms of consequences for Beijing over the virus. “I can do a lot,” he said.
Among the ideas under consideration are sanctions, a new round of tariffs or other trade restrictions, and a possible effort to lift China’s sovereign immunity, two sources said.
The strongest pressure for action is coming from the National Security Council, including deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger, while Treasury officials are advising caution, the sources said.
Conversations are at a very preliminary stage and significant action is not considered imminent, the sources said. When asked, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has repeatedly said Washington’s priority at the moment was to fight the virus but warned the time to hold Chinese accountable would come.
“Timing matters,” one of the sources said, and added that there was still much debate to be had on any tangible measures. (Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk, Matt Spetalnick, Jeff Mason and Tim Ahmann Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jonathan Oatis)",[]

During the months-long Republican effort to tear down the Affordable Care Act, at no point did Donald Trump ever sit down for talks with congressional Democrats. This was neither an accident nor an oversight. As regular readers may recall , it was an open secret that Republicans were terrified of the prospect of the president negotiating directly with Democratic leaders.
The fear, of course, was that the amateur president would sit down Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, he’d find their pitch compelling, and Trump would end up giving Dems everything they asked for.
Similarly, about a year ago, White House officials balked at allowing Trump to hold private negotiations with proponents of a bipartisan immigration reform measure. Again, people close to the president, realizing that he didn’t know anything about the subject matter, and acknowledging the reality that the president was more interested in striking a deal than what the deal entailed, took great pains to prohibit one-on-one talks.
The likelihood of Trump being “tricked” into endorsing a good proposal was simply too high.
As the Republican president gets ready for another meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, those fears have risen anew. Politico reported the other day that White House officials believe it’s possible Trump will be “outfoxed” into giving away too much in Hanoi.
[Several] of the president’s top advisers] have expressed trepidation not only that the summit … may not yield big results. They worry, too, that Trump, eager to declare victory on the world stage, could make big concessions in exchange for empty promises of denuclearization. The push for a second summit came almost entirely from the president himself, according to current and former White House officials — but Trump remains undeterred. He has gushed about the “wonderful letters” he has received from Kim, as well as the “good rapport” he has developed with the North Korean leader and the enormous media coverage the event in Vietnam’s capital is likely to attract. Trump even bragged, in a phone call Tuesday with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, that he is the only person who can make progress on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, according to a person briefed on the conversation, and complained about negative news coverage he has received.
There’s an implicit understanding that often goes unstated: everyone seems to quietly realize that Trump doesn’t know what he’s doing. Worse, he doesn’t seem to care about his ignorance or incompetence – events like these are about “spectacle” – so the American leader makes no real effort to prepare for meetings such as these.
The Republican president entered the initial round of talks with the North Korean dictator in Singapore with minimal preparation – Trump went so far as to mock the very idea of doing pre-summit homework – and soon after, he made a series of concessions to Kim Jong-un in exchange for effectively nothing.
Will this round be any different? During a call with reporters last week, a senior administration official insisted, “The president is doing everything necessary to be well prepared for this summit.” Five minutes later, Trump began tweeting about an actor accused of orchestrating an attack against him for publicity. Soon after, he tweeted his support for a GOP senator’s re-election bid – 19 months before voters go to the polls.
The lack of focus didn’t inspire confidence.
What’s more, there’s little doubt that Pyongyang already sees the American leader as a man whose incompetence can be exploited. Bloomberg had a good report on these lines late last week:
“They do look to get President Trump in a room and see what they might get out of him,” said Christopher Hill, the North Korea negotiator under President George W. Bush. “If Singapore is any indication, the president seeks to want to negotiate everything himself.” Kim and his team seem to be betting on a repeat. A senior Trump administration official, who asked not to be identified discussing internal deliberations, said North Korean officials have so far given little away in their meetings with the top U.S. envoy for the talks, Stephen Biegun. The official said the fear is that Kim will make an offer to Trump that sounds good at the moment, inspiring the president to sacrifice something in return that goes too far.
No modern White House had to worry about such things, largely because U.S. officials trusted their boss to be responsible and sensible during delicate negotiations.
In this administration, there’s a broad understanding that Donald Trump is … how do I put this delicately … different, and that creates an unsettling amount of uncertainty about what the president, desperate for progress, might give away to the dictator he claims to have fallen in love with.","['concessions', 'mock', 'minimal', 'preparation']"
